headline: The genetic architecture of language functional connectivity
teasing: Using data from the UK Biobank, the world's largest general population imaging-genetics cohort, a collaboration led by a team at BAOBAB (NeuroSpin) has identified genes involved in the genetic architecture of functional language connectivity. These genes could be a priority for studying natural language.

In the present study, to analyse the genetic architecture of language functional connectivity, researchers performed a genome-wide multivariate association analysis between genetic variations and resting-state functional connectivity of 25 classic language brain areas, extracted from a meta-analysis of 129 fMRI studies of language tasks, in 32,186 participants from the UK Biobank. Three hundred FCs were calculated between all pairs of the regions considered. Of these, 142 were found to be significantly heritable and were included in the subsequent multivariate association study. Twenty genomic loci were found to be associated with language FC. Among them, the **EPHA3** gene, putatively involved in dyspraxia, dyslexia and specific language impairment, was found to be associated with the fronto-parieto-temporal semantic network. The **THBS1** gene, involved in synaptogenesis, proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells is associated with the perceptual-motor interaction required for language. Finally, the **PLCE1** gene has a potential role in the bilateral frontotemporal auditory-motor network.

Using a multivariate approach, the researchers studied language using data from the largest imaging-genetics cohort to date, without language-related cognitive scores or language-oriented fMRI tasks. They identified potential key language-related genes that could provide new insights into the neurobiology of this complex process.

Functional connectivities (FC) represent correlations between the average fMRI signals of the regions under consideration.
