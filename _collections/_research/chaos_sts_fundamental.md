&#169; NeuroSpin/CEA. The asymmetry of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) has been identified
as a species-specific feature of the human brain. The so-called superior
temporal asymmetrical pit (STAP) area is observed from the last trimester
of gestation onwards and is far less pronounced in the chimpanzee brain.

This asymmetry is associated with more frequent sulcal interruptions,
named plis de passage (PPs), leading to the irregular morphology of the
left sulcus. Y Le Guen (PhD 2015-2018) and colleagues 
(NeuroSpin/Brainomics) worked to characterize the variability, asymmetry,
and heritability of these interruptions in the STS in comparison with the
other main sulci. We developed an automated method to extract PPs across
the cortex based on a highly reproducible grid of sulcal pits across
individuals, which they applied to a subset of Human Connectome Project
(HCP) subjects (N = 820). Only a few PPs across the cortex are
genetically constrained, namely in the collateral, postcentral and
superior temporal sulci and the calcarine fissure. Moreover, some PPs
occur more often in one hemisphere than the other, namely in the
precentral, postcentral, intraparietal sulci, as well as in both inferior
and superior temporal sulci. Most importantly, we found that only the
interruptions within the STAP region are both asymmetric and genetically
constrained. Because this morphological pattern is located in an area of
the left hemisphere related to speech, these results suggest structural
constraints on the architecture of the linguistic network.
