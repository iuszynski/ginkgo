In recent years, multiple models have been successfully applied to brain tumour segmentation tasks. However, the performance and stability of these models have never been evaluated when the training and target domain differ. In this study, we identify object detection as a simpler problem that can be injected into a segmentation model as an a priori, and which can increase the performance of our models. We propose an automatic segmentation model that, without model retraining or adaptation, showed good results when applied to a rare brain tumour.
