We use current unvaluable international resources as reference for imaging genetics. In particular  we estimate reference values for heritability of brain phenotypes. Many databases are available for imaging-genetics like <a class="external" target="_blank"  href="http://www.braineac.org/">braineacs</a> or <a class="external" target="_blank"  href="https://gtexportal.org/home/">GTEx</a>, but we specifically invest efforts on four cohorts that contain high quality MR images, and pedigree or genotyping information: (i) the <a class="external" target="_blank"  href="https://imaging.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK Biobank</a> cohort will gather up to 100,000 control subjects with MR and genetics, (ii) the <a class="external" target="_blank"  href="https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/overview">Human Connectom Project</a> youg control adult cohort consisting in 1,200 subjcts with MR pedigree and genotyping, (iii) the <a class="external" target="_blank"  href="http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/index.html">Healthy Brain Cohort</a> with ~2,000 control adolescents and, (iv) the <a class="external" target="_blank"  href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu/">ADNI cohort</a> which includes longitudinal MR and genetics to study Alzheimer's disease.

We obtained access to these data and we analyzed them for various scientific projects (see recent publications).
