abstract = {BACKGROUND Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare form of extra-nodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma. PCNSL is a distinct subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with over 95{\%} of tumors belonging to the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) group. We have conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on immunocompetent patients to address the possibility that common genetic variants influence the risk of developing PCNSL. METHODS We performed a meta-analysis of two new genome-wide association studies of PCNSL totaling 475 cases and 1,134 controls of European ancestry. To increase genomic resolution, we imputed {\textgreater}10 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the 1000 Genomes Project combined with UK10K as reference. In addition we performed a transcription factor binding disruption analysis and investigated the patterns of local chromatin patterns by capture Hi-C data. RESULTS We identified independent risk loci at 3p22.1 (rs41289586, ANO10, P = 2.17 x 10-8) and 6p25.3 near EXOC2 (rs116446171, P = 1.95 x 10-13). In contrast the lack of an association between rs41289586 and DLBCL, suggests distinct germline predisposition to PCNSL and DLBCL. We found looping chromatin interactions between non-coding regions at 6p25.3 (rs11646171) with the IRF4 promoter and at 8q24.21 (rs13254990) with the MYC promoter, both genes with strong relevance to B-cell tumorigenesis. CONCLUSION To our knowledge this is the first study providing insight into the genetic predisposition to PCNSL. Our findings represent an important step in defining the contribution of common genetic variation to the risk of developing PCNSL.},

 Background Neuroimaging studies of
 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have most
 commonly reported volumetric abnormalities in the basal
 ganglia, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortices. Few studies
 have examined the relationship between ADHD symptomatology
 and brain structure in population-based samples. We
 investigated the relationship between dimensional measures
 of ADHD symptomatology, brain structure, and reaction time
 variability—an index of lapses in attention. We also
 tested for associations between brain structural correlates
 of ADHD symptomatology and maps of dopaminergic gene
 expression. Methods Psychopathology and imaging data were
 available for 1538 youths. Parent ratings of ADHD symptoms
 were obtained using the Development and Well-Being
 Assessment and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
 (SDQ). Self-reports of ADHD symptoms were assessed using
 the youth version of the SDQ. Reaction time variability was
 available in a subset of participants. For each measure,
 whole-brain voxelwise regressions with gray matter volume
 were calculated. Results Parent ratings of ADHD symptoms
 (Development and Well-Being Assessment and SDQ), adolescent
 self-reports of ADHD symptoms on the SDQ, and reaction time
 variability were each negatively associated with gray
 matter volume in an overlapping region of the ventromedial
 prefrontal cortex. Maps of DRD1 and DRD2 gene expression
 were associated with brain structural correlates of ADHD
 symptomatology. Conclusions This is the first study to
 reveal relationships between ventromedial prefrontal cortex
 structure and multi-informant measures of ADHD symptoms in
 a large population-based sample of adolescents. Our results
 indicate that ventromedial prefrontal cortex structure is a
 biomarker for ADHD symptomatology. These findings extend
 previous research implicating the default mode network and
 dopaminergic dysfunction in ADHD.},

  Abstract                 = {Reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks is a key
 issue for functional genomic. Indeed, unraveling complex
 interactions among genes is a crucial step in order to
 understand their role in cellular processes.
 High-throughput technologies such as DNA microarrays or
 ChIP on chip have in principle opened the door to network
 inference from data. However the size of available data is
 still limited compared to their dimension. Machine learning
 methods have thus to be worked out in order to respond to
 this challenge. In this work we focused our attention on
 modeling gene regulatory networks with Bayesian networks.
 Bayesian networks offer a probabilistic framework for the
 reconstruction of biological interactions networks using
 data, but the structure learning problem is still a
 bottleneck. In this paper, we use evolutionary algorithms
 to stochastically evolve a set of candidate Bayesian
 networks structures and find the model that best explains
 the small number of available observational data. We
 propose different kinds of recombination strategies and an
 appropriate technique of niching that ensure diversity
 among candidate solutions. Tests are carried out on
 simulated data drawn from a biorealistic network. The
 effect of deterministic crowding, a niching method, is
 compared to mutation for different kinds of recombination
 strategies and is shown to improve significantly the
 performances. Enhanced by deterministic crowding, our
 evolutionary approach outperforms K2, Greedy-search and
 MCMC, for training sets whose size is small compared to the
 standard in machine learning. {\textcopyright}

  Abstract                 = {Background: Inferring gene regulatory networks from data
 requires the development of algorithms devoted to structure
 extraction. When only static data are available, gene
 interactions may be modelled by a Bayesian Network (BN)
 that represents the presence of direct interactions from
 regulators to regulees by conditional probability
 distributions. We used enhanced evolutionary algorithms to
 stochastically evolve a set of candidate BN structures and
 found the model that best fits data without prior
 knowledge. Results: We proposed various evolutionary
 strategies suitable for the task and tested our choices
 using simulated data drawn from a given bio-realistic
 network of 35 nodes, the so-called insulin network, which
 has been used in the literature for benchmarking. We
 assessed the inferred models against this reference to
 obtain statistical performance results. We then compared
 performances of evolutionary algorithms using two kinds of
 recombination operators that operate at different scales in
 the graphs. We introduced a niching strategy that
 reinforces diversity through the population and avoided
 trapping of the algorithm in one local minimum in the early
 steps of learning. We show the limited effect of the
 mutation operator when niching is applied. Finally, we
 compared our best evolutionary approach with various well
 known learning algorithms (MCMC, K2, greedy search, TPDA,
 MMHC) devoted to BN structure learning. Conclusion: We
 studied the behaviour of an evolutionary approach enhanced
 by niching for the learning of gene regulatory networks
 with BN. We show that this approach outperforms classical
 structure learning methods in elucidating the original
 model. These results were obtained for the learning of a
 bio-realistic network and, more importantly, on various
 small datasets. This is a suitable approach for learning
 transcriptional regulatory networks from real datasets
 without prior knowledge. {\textcopyright} 2008 Auliac et

 investigated the prevalence of disordered eating cognitions
 and behaviours across mid-adolescence in a large European
 sample, and explored the extent to which prevalence ratings
 were affected by informant (parent/adolescent), or the sex
 or age of the adolescent. The Development and Well-Being
 Assessment was completed by parent–adolescent dyads at
 age 14 (n = 2225) and again at age 16 (n = 1607) to
 explore the prevalence of 7 eating disorder symptoms (binge
 eating, purging, fear of weight gain, distress over
 shape/weight, avoidance of fattening foods, food
 restriction, and exercise for weight loss). Informant
 agreement was assessed using kappa coefficients.
 Generalised estimating equations were performed to explore
 the impact of age, sex and informant on symptom prevalence.
 Slight to fair agreement was observed between parent and
 adolescent reports (kappa estimates between 0.045 and
 0.318); however, this was largely driven by agreement on
 the absence of behaviours. Disordered eating behaviours
 were more consistently endorsed amongst girls compared to
 boys (odds ratios: 2.96–5.90) and by adolescents compared
 to their parents (odds ratios: 2.71–9.05). Our data are
 consistent with previous findings in epidemiological
 studies. The findings suggest that sex-related differences
 in the prevalence of disordered eating behaviour are
 established by mid-adolescence. The greater prevalence
 rates obtained from adolescent compared to parent reports
 may be due to the secretive nature of the behaviours and/or
 lack of awareness by parents. If adolescent reports are
 overlooked, the disordered behaviour may have a greater
 opportunity to become more entrenched.},

 radioprotective effect by fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
 has been extensively described since the early 1990s;
 however, the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely
 unknown. Radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
 lead to a complex set of responses in eukaryotic cells. One
 of the earliest consequences is phosphorylation of histone
 H2AX to form nuclear foci of the phosphorylated form of
 H2AX ($\gamma$H2AX) in the chromatin adjacent to sites of
 DSBs and to initiate the recruitment of DNA-repair
 molecules. Upon a DSB event, a rapid signaling network is
 activated to coordinate DNA repair with the induction of
 cell-cycle checkpoints. To date, three kinases (ATM, ATR,
 and DNA-PK) have been shown to phosphorylate histone H2AX
 in response to irradiation. Here, we report a
 kinome-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to
 characterize human kinases involved in H2AX
 phosphorylation. By analyzing $\gamma$H2AX foci at a
 single-nucleus level, we identified 46 kinases involved
 either directly or indirectly in H2AX phosphorylation in
 response to irradiation in human keratinocytes.
 Furthermore, we demonstrate that in response to
 irradiation, the FGFR4 signaling cascade promotes JNK1
 activation and direct H2AX phosphorylation leading, in
 turn, to more efficient DNA repair. This can explain, at
 least partially, the radioprotective effect of FGF.},

 imaging responses to three paradigms- the stop-signal,

 in youths at age 14, as part of the IMAGEN study. At
 baseline, youths from London and Dublin sites were assessed
 on psychotic-like experiences, and those reporting
 significant experiences were compared with matched control
 subjects. Significant brain activity differences between
 the groups were used to predict, with cross-validation, the
 presence of psychotic symptoms in the context of mood
 fluctuation at age 16, assessed in the full sample. These
 prediction analyses were conducted with the London-Dublin
 subsample (N=246) and the full sample (N=1,196). Results:
 Relative to control subjects, youths reporting
 psychotic-like experiencesshowed increased hippocampus/
 amygdala activity during processing of neutral faces and
 reduced dorsolateral prefrontal activity during failed
 inhibition. The most prominent regional difference for
 classifying 16-year-olds with mood fluctuation and
 psychotic symptoms relative to the control groups (those
 with mood fluctuations but no psychotic symptoms and those
 with no mood symptoms) was hyperactivation of the
 hippocampus/ amygdala, when controlling for baseline
 psychotic-like experiences and cannabis use. Conclusions:
 The results stress the importance of the limbic network's
 increased response to neutral facial stimuli as a marker of
 the extended psychosis phenotype. These findings might help
 to guide early intervention strategies for at-risk

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2018, The Author(s) 2018. Trait
 disinhibition, a clinical-liability construct, has
 well-established correlates in the diagnostic, self-rating,
 task-behavioral, and brain potential response domains.
 Recently, studies have begun to test for neuroimaging
 correlates of this liability factor, but more work of this
 type using larger data sets is needed to clarify its brain
 bases. The current study details the development and
 validation of a scale measure of trait disinhibition
 composed of questionnaire items available in the IMAGEN
 project, a large-scale longitudinal study of factors
 contributing to substance abuse that includes clinical
 interview, self-report personality, task-behavioral,
 neuroimaging, and genomic measures. Using a
 construct-rating and psychometric refinement approach, a
 scale was developed that evidenced: (a) positive relations
 with interview-assessed psychopathology in the IMAGEN
 sample, both concurrently and prospectively and (b)
 positive associations with scale measures of disinhibition
 and reported psychopathology, and a robust negative
 correlation with P3 brain response, in a separate adult
 sample (M age = 19.5). These findings demonstrate that a
 common scale measure can index this construct from
 adolescence through to early adulthood, and set the stage
 for systematic work directed at identifying neural and
 genetic biomarkers of this key liability construct using
 existing and future data from the IMAGEN project.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} American Psychological Association. The
 traditional view that mental disorders are distinct,
 categorical disorders has been challenged by evidence that
 disorders are highly comorbid and exist on a continuum
 (e.g., Caspi et al., 2014; Tackett et al., 2013). The first
 objective of this study was to use structural equation
 modeling to model the structure of psychopathology in an
 adolescent community-based sample (N = 2,144) including
 conduct disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
 (ADHD), oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD),
 obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, substance
 use, anxiety, depression, phobias, and other emotional
 symptoms, assessed at 16 years. The second objective was to
 identify common personality and cognitive correlates of
 psychopathology, assessed at 14 years. Results showed that
 psychopathology at 16 years fit 2 bifactor models equally
 well: (a) a bifactor model, reflecting a general
 psychopathology factor, as well as specific externalizing
 (representing mainly substance misuse and low ADHD) and
 internalizing factors; and (b) a bifactor model with a
 general psychopathology factor and 3 specific externalizing
 (representing mainly ADHD and ODD), substance use and
 internalizing factors. The general psychopathology factor
 was related to high disinhibition/impulsivity, low
 agreeableness, high neuroticism and hopelessness, high
 delay-discounting, poor response inhibition and low
 performance IQ. Substance use was specifically related to
 high novelty-seeking, sensation-seeking, extraversion, high
 verbal IQ, and risk-taking. Internalizing psychopathology
 was specifically related to high neuroticism, hopelessness
 and anxiety-sensitivity, low novelty-seeking and
 extraversion, and an attentional bias toward negatively
 valenced verbal stimuli. Findings reveal several
 nonspecific or transdiagnostic personality and cognitive
 factors that may be targeted in new interventions to
 potentially prevent the development of multiple
 psychopathologies.},

 common variance across conduct disorder, substancemisuse,
 and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to
 investigate the neurocognitive factors that relate
 generally or uniquely to externalizing problems in
 adolescence. Method: Personality and behavioralmeasures and
 functional imaging responses to reward sensitivity and
 response inhibition tasks were assessed in 1,778 European
 adolescents at age 14 and, using structural equation
 modeling, were related to the unique and common variance
 across externalizing problems assessed and modeled at ages
 14 and 16. Results: Externalizing problems best fit a
 general-specific model made up of a specific factor
 representing ADHD and conduct disorder symptoms, a specific
 factor representing substance misuse symptoms, and a common
 externalizing factor representing the variance shared among
 all symptoms. Common variance across externalizing problems
 was associated with high impulsivity and delay discounting
 as well as low blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response
 in the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus but high
 BOLD response in the presupplementary motor area and
 precentral gyrus during successful inhibition. Unique
 variance for ADHD/ conduct disorder was associated with
 impulsivity, poor response inhibition, and high delay
 discounting, aswell as low BOLD response in frontal brain
 areas bilaterally during failed inhibition. In contrast,
 unique variance for substance misuse was associated with
 high sensation seeking and delay discounting, as well as
 differential brain response to reward anticipation: High
 BOLD response in the left orbitofrontal cortex but low BOLD
 response in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Conclusions:
 Personality, behavioral, and fMRI findings suggest that
 abnormalities in response inhibition, error processing, and
 reward processing are differentially implicated in
 underlying vulnerability specific to ADHD/conduct disorder
 and substance misuse and general to externalizing
 problems.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Background: The
 EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) is to
 date the largest multi-centre, multi-disciplinary
 observational study on biomarkers for autism spectrum
 disorder (ASD). The current paper describes the clinical
 characteristics of the LEAP cohort and examines age, sex
 and IQ differences in ASD core symptoms and common
 co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. A companion paper
 describes the overall design and experimental protocol and
 outlines the strategy to identify stratification
 biomarkers. Methods: From six research centres in four
 European countries, we recruited 437 children and adults
 with ASD and 300 controls between the ages of 6 and 30
 years with IQs varying between 50 and 148. We conducted
 in-depth clinical characterisation including a wide range
 of observational, interview and questionnaire measures of
 the ASD phenotype, as well as co-occurring psychiatric
 symptoms. Results: The cohort showed heterogeneity in ASD
 symptom presentation, with only minimal to moderate site
 differences on core clinical and cognitive measures. On
 both parent-report interview and questionnaire measures,
 ASD symptom severity was lower in adults compared to
 children and adolescents. The precise pattern of
 differences varied across measures, but there was some
 evidence of both lower social symptoms and lower repetitive
 behaviour severity in adults. Males had higher ASD symptom
 scores than females on clinician-rated and parent interview
 diagnostic measures but not on parent-reported dimensional
 measures of ASD symptoms. In contrast, self-reported ASD
 symptom severity was higher in adults compared to
 adolescents, and in adult females compared to males. Higher
 scores on ASD symptom measures were moderately associated
 with lower IQ. Both inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive
 ADHD symptoms were lower in adults than in children and
 adolescents, and males with ASD had higher levels of
 inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive ADHD symptoms than
 females. Conclusions: The established phenotypic
 heterogeneity in ASD is well captured in the LEAP cohort.
 Variation both in core ASD symptom severity and in commonly
 co-occurring psychiatric symptoms were systematically
 associated with sex, age and IQ. The pattern of ASD symptom
 differences with age and sex also varied by whether these
 were clinician ratings or parent- or self-reported which
 has important implications for establishing stratification
 biomarkers and for their potential use as outcome measures
 in clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {We determined a transcriptional profile specific for
 clonal stromal mesenchymal stem cells from adult and fetal

 stromal cell lines, we evaluated the adipocytic,
 osteoblastic, chondrocytic, and vascular smooth muscle
 differentiation potential and also the hematopoietic
 supportive (stromal) capacity of six mouse stromal cell
 lines from adult bone marrow and day 14.5 fetal liver. We
 found that two lines were quadripotent and also supported
 hematopoiesis, BMC9 from bone marrow and AFT024 from fetal
 liver. We then ascertained the set of genes differentially
 expressed in the intersection set of AFT024 and BMC9
 compared with those expressed in the union set of two
 negative control lines, 2018 and BFC012 (both from fetal
 liver); 346 genes were upregulated and 299 downregulated.
 Using Ingenuity software, we found two major gene networks
 with highly significant scores. One network contained
 downregulated genes that are known to be implicated in
 osteoblastic differentiation, proliferation, or
 transformation. The other network contained upregulated
 genes that belonged to two categories, cytoskeletal genes
 and genes implicated in the transcriptional machinery. The
 data extend the concept of stromal mesenchymal stem cells
 to clonal cell populations derived not only from bone
 marrow but also from fetal liver. The gene networks
 described should discriminate this cell type from other
 types of stem cells and help define the stem cell state.

 structural descriptions which are compared, rather than the

 the individual occurrence of the activations detected at a

 individual anatomy of each subject. The analysis starts
 with a hierarchical multiscale object-based description of
 each individual map. These descriptions are then compared,
 rather than comparing the images directly. The analysis is
 thus performed at an object level instead of voxel by
 voxel. It is made using a comparison graph, on which a
 labeling process is performed. The label field on the graph

 (IHI), also known as malrotation, is an atypical anatomical
 pattern of the hippocampus, which has been reported in
 healthy subjects in different studies. However, extensive
 characterization of IHI in a large sample has not yet been
 performed. Furthermore, it is unclear whether IHI are
 restricted to the medial-temporal lobe or are associated
 with more extensive anatomical changes. Here, we studied
 the characteristics of IHI in a community-based sample of
 2008 subjects of the IMAGEN database and their association
 with extra-hippocampal anatomical variations. The presence
 of IHI was assessed on T1-weighted anatomical magnetic
 resonance imaging (MRI) using visual criteria. We assessed
 the association of IHI with other anatomical changes
 throughout the brain using automatic morphometry of
 cortical sulci. We found that IHI were much more frequent
 in the left hippocampus (left: 17{\%}, right: 6{\%}, $\chi$
 2 - test, p {\textless} 10 -28 ). Compared to subjects
 without IHI, subjects with IHI displayed morphological
 changes in several sulci located mainly in the limbic lobe.
 Our results demonstrate that IHI are a common left-sided
 phenomenon in normal subjects and that they are associated
 with morphological changes outside the medial temporal lobe.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Research using the Stop Signal Task employing an adaptive algorithm to accommodate individual differences often report inferior performance on the task in individuals with ADHD, OCD, and substance use disorders compared to non-clinical controls. Furthermore, individuals with deficits in inhibitory control tend to show reduced neural activity in key inhibitory regions during successful stopping. However, the adaptive algorithm systematically introduces performance-related differences in objective task difficulty that may influence the estimation of individual differences in stop-related neural activity. This report examines the effect that these algorithm-related differences have on the measurement of neural activity during the stop signal task. We compared two groups of subjects (n=210) who differed in inhibitory ability using both a standard fMRI analysis and an analysis that resampled trials to remove the objective task difficulty confound. The results show that objective task difficulty influences the magnitude of between-group differences and that controlling for difficulty attenuates stop-related activity differences between superior and poor inhibitors. Specifically, group differences in the right inferior frontal gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, and left inferior frontal gyrus are diminished when differences in objective task difficulty are controlled for. Also, when objective task difficulty effects are exaggerated, group differences in stop related activity emerge in other regions of the stopping network. The implications of these effects for how we interpret individual differences in activity levels are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Brain imaging is a natural intermediate phenotype to
 understand the link between genetic information and
 behavior or brain pathologies risk factors. Massive efforts
 have been made in the last few years to acquire
 high-dimensional neuroimaging and genetic data on large
 cohorts of subjects. The statistical analysis of such data
 is carried out with increasingly sophisticated techniques
 and represents a great computational challenge.
 Fortunately, increasing computational power in distributed
 architectures can be harnessed, if new neuroinformatics
 infrastructures are designed and training to use these new
 tools is provided. Combining a MapReduce framework
 (TomusBLOB) with machine learning algorithms (Scikit-learn
 library), we design a scalable analysis tool that can deal
 with non-parametric statistics on high-dimensional data.
 End-users describe the statistical procedure to perform and
 can then test the model on their own computers before
 running the very same code in the cloud at a larger scale.
 We illustrate the potential of our approach on real data
 with an experiment showing how the functional signal in
 subcortical brain regions can be significantly fit with
 genome-wide genotypes. This experiment demonstrates the
 scalability and the reliability of our framework in the
 cloud with a 2 weeks deployment on hundreds of virtual
 machines. {\textcopyright} 2014 Da Mota, Tudoran, Costan,

 the MRI data. The protocol was tested on two baboon brains
 for which the full series of slices were available, and a
 macaque brain for which a subset only of the histological
 slices were available demonstrating the ability of building
 digital atlases in the MRI geometry without mounting and
 staining all the brain slices. We then studied the accuracy
 of mapping the digital atlas of one baboon onto the MRI of
 the other baboon by comparing the overlapping with its
 original digital atlas. We finally used the digital atlas
 of one of the baboons to study the individual kinetic of
 the main thalamus nuclei on Positron Emission Tomography

 measuring very fine and local functional differences.

 series of stained histological slices of a baboon brain
 with an anatomical MRI scan of the same subject using an
 intermediate 3D-consistent volume of "blockface"
 photographs taken during the sectioning process. Each
 stained histological section of the baboon brain was first
 registered to its corresponding blockface photograph using
 a novel "hemi-rigid" transformation. This piecewise rigid
 2D transformation was specifically adapted to the
 registration of slices which contained both hemispheres.
 Subsenquently, to correct the global 3D deformations of the
 brain caused by histological preparation and fixation, a 3D
 elastic transformation was estimated between the blockface
 volume and the MRI data. This 3D elastic transformation was
 then applied to the histological volume previously aligned
 using the hemi-rigid method to complete the registration of
 the series of stained histological slices with the MRI
 data. We assessed the efficacy of our method by evaluating
 the quality of matching of anatomical features as well as
 the difference of volume measurements between the MRI and
 the histological images. Two complete baboon brains (with
 the exception of cerebellum) were successfully processed

 First, for each slice, a scale-space analysis of the
 histogram provides a set of alternative interpretations in
 terms of tissue classes. Each of these interpretations can
 lead to a different classification of the related slice. A
 simple heuristics selects for each slice the most plausible
 interpretation. Then, an iterative procedure refines the
 interpretation selections across the series in order to
 maximize a score measuring the spatial consistency of the
 classifications across contiguous slices. Results are
 presented for a series of 121 baboon slices.

 rights reserved. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) $\epsilon$4
 allele is the best established genetic risk factor for
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been previously associated
 with alterations in structural gray matter and changes in
 functional brain activity in healthy middle-aged
 individuals and older non-demented subjects. In order to
 determine the neural mechanism by which APOE polymorphisms
 affect white matter (WM) structure, we investigated the
 diffusion characteristics of WM tracts in carriers and
 non-carriers of the APOE $\epsilon$4 and $\epsilon$2
 alleles using an unbiased whole brain analysis technique
 (Tract Based Spatial Statistics) in a healthy young
 adolescent (14 years) cohort. A large sample of healthy
 young adolescents (n = 575) were selected from the European
 neuro imaging-genetics IMAGEN study with available APOE
 status and accompanying diffusion imaging data. MR
 Diffusion data was acquired on 3T systems using 32
 diffusion-weighted (DW) directions and 4 non-DW volumes
 (b-value = 1,300 s/mm {\textless} sup {\textgreater} 2
 {\textless} /sup {\textgreater} and isotropic resolution of
 2.4×2.4×2.4 mm). No significant differences in WM
 structure were found in diffusion indices between carriers
 and non-carriers of the APOE $\epsilon$4 and $\epsilon$2
 alleles, and dose-dependent effects of these variants were
 not established, suggesting that differences in WM
 structure are not modulated by the APOE polymorphism. In
 conclusion, our results suggest that microstructural
 properties of WM structure are not associated with the APOE
 $\epsilon$4 and $\epsilon$2 alleles in young adolescence,
 suggesting that the neural effects of these variants are
 not evident in 14-year-olds and may only develop later in life.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. To analyze
 the involvement of different brain regions in behavioral
 inhibition and impulsiveness, differences in activation
 were investigated in fMRI data from a response inhibition
 task, the stop-signal task, in 1709 participants. First,
 areas activated more in stop-success (SS) than stop-failure
 (SF) included the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)
 extending into the inferior frontal gyrus (ventrolateral
 prefrontal cortex, BA 47/12), and the dorsolateral
 prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Second, the anterior cingulate
 and anterior insula (AI) were activated more on failure
 trials, specifically in SF versus SS. The interaction
 between brain region and SS versus SF activations was
 significant (P=5.6 * 10 -8 ). The results provide new
 evidence from this "big data" investigation consistent with
 the hypotheses that the lateral OFC is involved in the
 stop-related processing that inhibits the action; that the
 DLPFC is involved in attentional processes that influence
 task performance; and that the AI and anterior cingulate
 are involved in emotional processes when failure occurs.
 The investigation thus emphasizes the role of the human
 lateral OFC BA 47/12 in changing behavior, and inhibiting
 behavior when necessary. A very similar area in BA47/12 is
 involved in changing behavior when an expected reward is
 not obtained, and has been shown to have high functional
 connectivity in depression.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Dickie et al. Face expressions are a
 rich source of social signals. Here we estimated the
 proportion of phenotypic variance in the brain response to
 facial expressions explained by common genetic variance
 captured by ∼500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms.
 Using genomic-relationship-matrix restricted maximum
 likelihood (GREML), we related this global genetic variance
 to that in the brain response to facial expressions, as
 assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
 in a community-based sample of adolescents (n = 1,620).
 Brain response to facial expressions was measured in 25
 regions constituting a face network, as defined previously.
 In 9 out of these 25 regions, common genetic variance
 explained a significant proportion of phenotypic variance
 (40–50{\%}) in their response to ambiguous facial
 expressions; this was not the case for angry facial
 expressions. Across the network, the strength of the
 genotype-phenotype relationship varied as a function of the
 inter-individual variability in the number of functional
 connections possessed by a given region (R 2  = 0.38, p
 {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, this variability showed an
 inverted U relationship with both the number of observed
 connections (R 2  = 0.48, p {\textless} 0.001) and the
 magnitude of brain response (R 2  = 0.32, p {\textless}
 0.001). Thus, a significant proportion of the brain
 response to facial expressions is predicted by common
 genetic variance in a subset of regions constituting the
 face network. These regions show the highest
 inter-individual variability in the number of connections
 with other network nodes, suggesting that the genetic model
 captures variations across the adolescent brains in
 co-opting these regions into the face network.},

 scanners (microPET) dedicated to the in vivo functional
 study of small animals, autoradiography remains the
 reference technique widely used for functional brain
 imaging and the gold standard for the validation of in vivo
 results. The analysis of autoradiographic data is
 classically achieved in two dimensions (2D) using a
 section-by-section approach, is often limited to few
 sections and the delineation of the regions of interest to
 be analysed is directly performed on autoradiographic
 sections. In addition, such approach of analysis does not
 accommodate the possible anatomical shifts linked to
 dissymmetry associated with the sectioning process. This
 classic analysis is time-consuming, operator-dependent and
 can therefore lead to non-objective and non-reproducible
 results. In this paper, we have developed an automated and
 generic toolbox for processing of autoradiographic and
 corresponding histological rat brain sections based on a
 three-step approach, which involves: (1) an optimized
 digitization dealing with hundreds of autoradiographic and
 histological sections; (2) a robust reconstruction of the
 volumes based on a reliable registration method; and (3) an
 original 3D-geometry-based approach to analysis of
 anatomical and functional post-mortem data. The integration
 of the toolbox under a unified environment (in-house
 software BrainVISA, http://brainvisa.info) with a graphic

 exploitation of the overall anatomical and functional

 Voxel-wise statistical methods of analysis have long been
 used to determine differences in brain activity during in

 recently been applied to 3D reconstructed autoradiographic
 volume images from rat brains. We present here a fully
 automated analysis for autoradiographic data combining (1)
 computerized procedures for the acquisition and 3D
 reconstruction of postmortem volume images and (2) spatial
 normalization followed by classical whole-brain voxel-wise
 statistical analysis. We also describe an additional
 procedure for characterizing functional differences between
 the right and left hemispheres of the brain. We compared
 two spatial normalization techniques and evaluated how the
 effect of choosing a particular normalization technique
 impacted on the statistical analysis. We also propose a
 small volume correction analysis to address the problem of
 multiple statistical comparisons. Lastly, we investigated
 the reliability of such analyses, by comparing their
 results qualitatively and quantitatively with those
 previously obtained with our semiautomated ROI-based

 perspectives in early diagnosis and prognosis of brain
 diseases. Although such multivariate methods can capture
 complex relationships in the data, traditional approaches
 provide irregular (ℓ 2 penalty) or scattered ({\pounds}1

 A penalty like Total Variation (TV) that exploits the
 natural 3D structure of the images can increase the spatial
 coherence of the weight map. However, TV penalization leads
 to non-smooth optimization problems that are hard to
 minimize. We propose an optimization framework that
 minimizes any combination of ℓ 1 , ℓ 2 , and TV
 penalties while preserving the exact ℓ 1 penalty. This
 algorithm uses Nesterov's smoothing technique to
 approximate the TV penalty with a smooth function such that
 the loss and the penalties are minimized with an exact
 accelerated proximal gradient algorithm. We propose an
 original continuation algorithm that uses successively
 smaller values of the smoothing parameter to reach a
 prescribed precision while achieving the best possible
 convergence rate. This algorithm can be used with other
 losses or penalties. The algorithm is applied on a
 classification problem on the ADNI dataset. We observe that
 the TV penalty does not necessarily improve the prediction
 but provides a major breakthrough in terms of support
 recovery of the predictive brain regions. {\textcopyright}

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. The study of
 mental illness (mood disorders, schizophrenia, autism
 spectrum disorder) in neuroimaging has been addressed by
 standard "univariate" statistical analysis methods. These
 methods have revealed many structural and functional brain
 changes associated with these diseases. Such analysis
 answers the question: "Where in the brain and on the scale
 of a cohort of subjects/patients, are the associations
 between the pathology and any structural or functional
 related signal". This type of analysis has no predictive
 power to assist in the diagnosis or the prognosis of the
 response to a treatment at an individual level. In
 addition, these analyses typically involve examining each
 voxel separately (measured signal at given locus), thus
 limiting the identification of "patterns" that jointly
 involve several brain regions. Taking into account the fact
 that brain alterations in psychiatric diseases expand over
 a widely distributed network of brain regions, the
 neuroimaging community turned to multivariate predictive
 methods because of their ability to examine voxels jointly
 and their potential for making inferences at a
 single-subject level. This article provides a critical
 overview of the current applications of multivariate
 prediction methods for the identification of biomarkers
 based on neuroimaging in the prospect of using these for
 the diagnosis, early detection and response to treatment of
 mental illness.},

 emotional faces is an important prerequisite for adequate
 social interactions in daily life, and might thus
 specifically be altered in adolescence, a period marked by
 significant changes in social emotional processing.
 Previous research has shown that the cannabinoid receptor
 CB1R is associated with longer gaze duration and increased
 brain responses in the striatum to happy faces in adults,
 yet, for adolescents, it is not clear whether an
 association between CBR1 and face processing exists. In the
 present study we investigated genetic effects of the two
 CB1R polymorphisms, rs1049353 and rs806377, on the
 processing of emotional faces in healthy adolescents. They
 participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging
 during a Faces Task, watching blocks of video clips with
 angry and neutral facial expressions, and completed a

  Abstract                 = {The processing of emotional faces is an important prerequisite for adequate social interactions in daily life, and might thus specifically be altered in adolescence, a period marked by significant changes in social emotional processing. Previous research has shown that the cannabinoid receptor CB1R is associated with longer gaze duration and increased brain responses in the striatum to happy faces in adults, yet, for adolescents, it is not clear whether an association between CBR1 and face processing exists. In the present study we investigated genetic effects of the two CB1R polymorphisms, rs1049353 and rs806377, on the processing of emotional faces in healthy adolescents. They participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging during a Faces Task, watching blocks of video clips with angry and neutral facial expressions, and completed a Morphed Faces Task in the laboratory where they looked at different facial expressions that switched from anger to fear or sadness or from happiness to fear or sadness, and labelled them according to these four emotional expressions.

 growing number of cerebral imaging modalities. Interactive
 registration is easy to implement but is laborious and
 highly operator dependant. Utilization of automatic methods
 is easier but the development of such applications is much
 more complex. The aim of this work was to bring in clinical
 practice a fully unsupervised registration method initially
 designed for PET and MRI. Material, methods: MRI and SPECT
 images, 99m Tc-ECD and thallium 201, of 74 patients were
 registered during the development phase. The principle of
 the method used is external surface matching. Registered
 images were visualized with a specifically designed tool.
 Results : Registration was entirely automatic in 80{\%} of
 the cases. In the 20{\%} left, MRI and SPECT artifacts
 imposed simple modifications of the programs parameters to
 obtain a satisfactory result. Mean time for the whole
 process is 7 mn. Different superposition techniquse have
 been proposed according to the image kind. Conclusion :
 These results support the major importance of image quality
 in the successful utilization of automatic registration
 methods. Testing of the different superimposition modes
 indicates that the chosen one has to be fitted to the kind
 of images, particularly to the distribution of the
 scintigraphic tracer. The disponibility of such automatic
 tools introduces in clinical practice a new reading of
 scintigraphic information, anatomical structure recognition
 being no more a primary constraint.},

 examine whether this type of exposure triggers specific
 molecular responses, cultured primary keratinocytes
 isolated from adult normal skin were irradiated with single
 acute doses of 1 cGy or 2 Gy. DNA microarrays containing
 10,500 probes were used to assess transcriptional changes
 over a time course between 3 and 72 h postirradiation.
 Keratinocytes were studied at a differentiated stage to
 mimic the response of cells from the supra-basal layers of
 the epidermis. A major finding of this study was the
 identification of an important number of low-dose-specific
 genes (140), most of which were modulated at 48 h.
 Clustering analysis also revealed low-dose-specific
 profiles. One of these clusters (17 known genes) was
 further analyzed using Gibbs sampling algorithm, which led
 to the identification of 7 putative promoter sequences.
 These results show for the first time that low-dose
 ionizing radiation is able to induce specific
 transcriptional responses in human keratinocytes. Our
 findings support the potential usefulness of microarrays in
 biological dosimetry studies after low-dose exposures.

  Abstract                 = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 American Medical
 Association. All rights reserved. IMPORTANCE Cannabis use
 during adolescence is known to increase the risk for
 schizophrenia in men. Sex differences in the dynamics of
 brain maturation during adolescence may be of particular
 importance with regard to vulnerability of the male brain
 to cannabis exposure. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the
 association between cannabis use and cortical maturation in
 adolescents is moderated by a polygenic risk score for
 schizophrenia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
 Observation of 3 population-based samples included initial
 analysis in 1024 adolescents of both sexes from the
 Canadian Saguenay Youth Study (SYS) and follow-up in 426
 adolescents of both sexes from the IMAGEN Study from 8
 European cities and 504 male youth from the Avon
 Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) based
 in England. A total of 1577 participants (aged 12-21 years;
 899 [57.0{\%}] male) had (1) information about cannabis
 use; (2) imaging studies of the brain; and (3) a polygenic
 risk score for schizophrenia across 108 genetic loci
 identified by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Data
 analysis was performed from March 1 through December 31,
 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cortical thickness derived
 from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Linear
 regression tests were used to assess the relationships be
 tween cannabis use, cortical thickness, and risk score.
 RESULTS Across the 3 samples of 1574 participants, a
 negative association was observed between cannabis use in
 early adolescence and cortical thickness in male
 participants with a high polygenic risk score. This
 observation was not the case for low-risk male participants
 or for the low- or high-risk female participants. Thus, in
 SYS male participants, cannabis use interacted with risk
 score vis-{\`{a}}-vis cortical thickness (P = .009); higher
 scores were associated with lower thickness only in males
 who used cannabis. Similarly, in the IMAGEN male
 participants, cannabis use interacted with increased risk
 score vis-{\`{a}}-vis a change in decreasing cortical
 thickness from 14.5 to 18.5 years of age (t 137 = -2.36; P
 = .02). Finally, in the ALSPAC high-risk group of male
 participants, those who used cannabis most frequently
 (≥61 occasions) had lower cortical thickness than those
 who never used cannabis (difference in cortical thickness,
 0.07 [95{\%}CI, 0.01-0.12]; P = .02) and those with light
 use ( {\textless} 5 occasions) (difference in cortical
 thickness, 0.11 [95{\%}CI, 0.03-0.18]; P = .004).
 CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cannabis use in early adolescence
 moderates the association between the genetic risk for
 schizophrenia and cortical maturation among male
 individuals. This finding implicates processes underlying
 cortical maturation in mediating the link between cannabis
 use and liability to schizophrenia.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc. Multi-subject datasets
 used in neuroimaging group studies have a complex
 structure, as they exhibit non-stationary statistical
 properties across regions and display various
 artifacts.While studies with small sample sizes can rarely
 be shown to deviate from standard hypotheses (such as the
 normality of the residuals) due to the poor sensitivity of
 normality tests with low degrees of freedom, large-scale
 studies (e.g. {\textgreater} . 100 subjects) exhibit more
 obvious deviations from these hypotheses and call for more
 refined models for statistical inference. Here, we
 demonstrate the benefits of robust regression as a tool for
 analyzing large neuroimaging cohorts. First, we use an
 analytic test based on robust parameter estimates; based on
 simulations, this procedure is shown to provide an accurate
 statistical control without resorting to permutations.
 Second, we show that robust regression yields more
 detections than standard algorithms using as an example an
 imaging genetics study with 392 subjects. Third, we show
 that robust regression can avoid false positives in a
 large-scale analysis of brain-behavior relationships with
 over 1500 subjects. Finally we embed robust regression in
 the Randomized Parcellation Based Inference (RPBI) method
 and demonstrate that this combination further improves the
 sensitivity of tests carried out across the whole brain.
 Altogether, our results show that robust procedures provide
 important advantages in large-scale neuroimaging group
 studies.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of H 2 15 O PET scans for the measurement of
 myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) has been validated in
 both animal models and humans. Nevertheless, this protocol
 requires cumbersome acquisitions such as C 15 O inhalation
 or 18 F-FDG injection to obtain images suitable for
 determining myocardial regions of interest. Regularized
 factor analysis is an alternative method proposed to define
 myocardial contours directly from H 2 15 O studies without
 any C 15 O or FDG scan. The study validates this method by
 comparing the MPR obtained by the regularized factor
 analysis with the coronary flow reserve (CFR) obtained by
 intracoronary Doppler as well as with the MPR obtained by
 an FDG acquisition. Methods: Ten healthy volunteers and 10
 patients with ischemic cardiopathy or idiopathic dilated
 cardiomyopathy were investigated. The CFR of patients was
 measured sonographically using a Doppler catheter tip
 placed into the proximal left anterior descending artery.
 The mean velocity was recorded at baseline and after
 dipyridamole administration. All subjects underwent PET
 imaging, including 2 H 2 15 O myocardial perfusion studies
 at baseline and after dipyridamole infusion, followed by an
 FDG acquisition. Dynamic H 2 15 O scans were processed by
 regularized factor analysis. Left ventricular cavity and
 anteroseptal myocardial regions of interest were drawn
 independently on regularized factor images and on FDG
 images. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) and MPR were estimated
 by fitting the H 2 15 O time-activity curves with a
 compartmental model. Results: In patients, no significant
 difference was observed among the 3 methods of
 measurement-Doppler CFR, 1.73 ± 0.57; regularized factor
 analysis MPR, 1.71 ± 0.68; FDG MPR, 1.83 ± 0.49-using a
 Friedman 2-way ANOVA by ranks. MPR measured with the
 regularized factor images correlated significantly with CFR
 (y = 1.1 7x - 0.30; r = 0.97). In the global population,
 the regularized factor analysis MPR and FDG MPR correlated
 strongly (y = 0.99x; r = 0.93). Interoperator repeatability
 on regularized factor images was 0.126 mL/min/g for rest
 MBF, 0.38 mL/min/g for stress MBF, and 0.34 for MPR (19{\%}
 of mean MPR). Conclusion: Regularized factor analysis
 provides well-defined myocardial images from H 2 15 O
 dynamic scans, permitting an accurate and simple
 measurement of MPR. The method reduces exposure to
 radiation and examination time and lowers the cost of MPR
 protocols using a PET scanner.},

 the object being imaged consists of anatomical domains with
 homogeneous true activity and that the voxel intensity in
 the PET image is the sum of the true activity in each
 domain weighted by its Regional Spread Function (RSF). The
 two implementations that we compare differ in the way the
 RSFs are obtained: 1) a 3D extension of the original work
 of Rousset, that is based on an analytical simulator, and
 2) a convolution of the anatomical tissue domains, in the
 image space, with the 3D PET system PSF. We used a Monte
 Carlo simulated cerebral dynamic study to assess the
 performance of both PVC implementations in the recovery of
 the time activity curves for the striata. The two methods
 allow the recovery of the true time activity curves with
 RMS errors of about 4{\%}. The advantage of the second
 approach is its simplicity and rapidity that would enable
 fully 3D PVC in a clinical context, for protocols dedicated
 to compartmental analysis that require a few accurate ROI
 time activity curves.}

  Abstract                 = {PET imaging of D 2 receptors or 18 F-L-dopa metabolism are
 reference protocols to follow and study neurodegenerative
 diseases, but the accuracy of striatal PET imaging is
 limited by the partial-volume effect (PVE). For such
 studies, the geometric transfer matrix (GTM) method has
 been proposed to correct the regional mean values for PVE
 and is now widely used. Methods: The GTM method models the
 geometric interactions induced by the PET system between
 the anatomic regions in which PVE correction is performed.
 This implies estimation of the corresponding regional
 spread function (RSF). The literature describes 2
 implementations for the RSF calculation; they differ in the
 way the point spread function (PSF) of the imaging system
 is modeled, but no comparison or discussion has been given.
 The first and reference implementation uses an accurate
 intrinsic detector PSF that is applied in the sinogram
 space. The second uses a global PSF that is applied in the
 image space. In this work, we compared the 2 GTM
 implementations for 3-dimensional (3D) PET striatal imaging
 using Monte Carlo simulations and a phantom study. We
 studied the robustness of the GTM correction with respect
 to residual registration errors between PET and anatomy and
 with respect to residual segmentation errors. Results:
 Despite the differences in RSF calculation and computation
 cost between the 2 implementations, similar recovery
 results were obtained (between 95{\%} and 100{\%}). The
 study of robustness of the GTM correction yielded 2
 results. A realistic residual misregistration between the
 anatomic and PET images did not modify the algorithm
 accuracy but decreased its precision. Conversely, a
 realistic residual missegmentation of the anatomic regions
 submitted to GTM correction decreased the correction
 accuracy. Conclusion: A simple but efficient implementation
 in the image space of the GTM method yields accurate PVE
 correction in striatal regions in studies with 3D PET and
 enables clinical use. The method is less sensitive to
 residual misregistration errors between PET and anatomy
 than to residual missegmentation of the anatomy. Special
 care should be taken with segmentation of the regions to
 correct for PVE.},

 2015. Background Resilience is the capacity of individuals
 to resist mental disorders despite exposure to stress.
 Little is known about its neural underpinnings. The
 putative variation of white-matter microstructure with
 resilience in adolescence, a critical period for brain
 maturation and onset of high-prevalence mental disorders,
 has not been assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
 Lower fractional anisotropy (FA) though, has been reported
 in the corpus callosum (CC), the brain's largest
 white-matter structure, in psychiatric and stress-related
 conditions. We hypothesized that higher FA in the CC would
 characterize stress-resilient adolescents. Method Three
 groups of adolescents recruited from the community were
 compared: resilient with low risk of mental disorder
 despite high exposure to lifetime stress (n = 55), at-risk
 of mental disorder exposed to the same level of stress (n =
 68), and controls (n = 123). Personality was assessed by
 the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). Voxelwise
 statistics of DTI values in CC were obtained using
 tract-based spatial statistics. Regional projections were
 identified by probabilistic tractography. Results Higher FA
 values were detected in the anterior CC of resilient
 compared to both non-resilient and control adolescents. FA
 values varied according to resilience capacity. Seed
 regional changes in anterior CC projected onto anterior
 cingulate and frontal cortex. Neuroticism and three other
 NEO-FFI factor scores differentiated non-resilient
 participants from the other two groups. Conclusion High FA
 was detected in resilient adolescents in an anterior CC
 region projecting to frontal areas subserving cognitive
 resources. Psychiatric risk was associated with personality
 characteristics. Resilience in adolescence may be related
 to white-matter microstructure.},

  Abstract                 = {Huntington's disease is a hereditary disease in which
 degeneration of neurons in the striatum leads to motor and
 cognitive deficits. Foetal striatal allografts reverse
 these deficits in phenotypic models of Huntington's disease
 developed in primates. A recent open-label pilot study has
 shown some clinical improvement or stabilization in three
 out of five Huntington's disease patients who received
 bilateral striatal grafts of foetal neurons. We show here
 that the clinical changes in these three patients were
 associated with a reduction of the striatal and cortical
 hypometabolism, demonstrating that grafts were able to
 restore the function of striato-cortical loops. Conversely,
 in the two patients not improved by the grafts, striatal
 and cortical hypometabolism progressed over the 2-year
 follow-up. Finally, detailed anatomical-functional analysis
 of the grafted striata, enabled by the 3D fusion of MRI and
 metabolic images, revealed considerable heterogeneity in
 the anatomic and metabolic profiles of grafted tissue, both
 within and between Huntington's disease patients. Our
 results demonstrate the usefulness of PET measurements of
 brain glucose metabolism in understanding the effects of
 foetal grafts in patients with Huntington's disease.},

 contribute to anxiety and depression disorders, but their
 relationship with brain functioning in adolescence has
 rarely been studied. We hypothesized that neural response
 to social threat would relate to NLE in the frontal-limbic
 emotional regions. Participants (N = 685) were drawn from
 the Imagen database of 14-year-old community adolescents
 recruited in schools. They underwent functional MRI while
 viewing angry and neutral faces, as a probe to neural
 response to social threat. Lifetime NLEs were assessed
 using the 'distress', 'family' and 'accident' subscales
 from a life event dimensional questionnaire. Relationships
 between NLE subscale scores and neural response were
 investigated. Links of NLE subscales scores with anxiety or
 depression outcomes at the age of 16 years were also
 investigated. Lifetime 'distress' positively correlated
 with ventral-lateral orbitofrontal and temporal cortex
 activations during angry face processing. 'Distress' scores
 correlated with the probabilities of meeting criteria for
 Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder
 at the age of 16 years. Lifetime 'family' and 'accident'
 scores did not relate with neural response or follow-up
 conditions, however. Thus, different types of NLEs
 differentially predicted neural responses to threat during
 adolescence, and differentially predicted a de novo
 internalizing condition 2 years later. The deleterious
 effect of self-referential NLEs is suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018. Ubiquitously expressed genes have been implicated in a variety of specific behaviors, including responses to ethanol. However, the mechanisms that confer this behavioral specificity have remained elusive. Previously, we showed that the ubiquitously expressed small GTPase Arf6 is required for normal ethanol-induced sedation in adult Drosophila. Here, we show that this behavioral response also requires Efa6, one of (at least) three Drosophila Arf6 guanine exchange factors. Ethanol-naive Arf6 and Efa6 mutants were sensitive to ethanol-induced sedation and lacked rapid tolerance upon re-exposure to ethanol, when compared with wild-type flies. In contrast to wild-type flies, both Arf6 and Efa6 mutants preferred alcohol-containing food without prior ethanol experience. An analysis of the human ortholog of Arf6 and orthologs of Efa6 (PSD1-4) revealed that the minor G allele of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs13265422 in PSD3, as well as a haplotype containing rs13265422, was associated with an increased frequency of drinking and binge drinking episodes in adolescents. The same haplotype was also associated with increased alcohol dependence in an independent European cohort. Unlike the ubiquitously expressed human Arf6 GTPase, PSD3 localization is restricted to the brain, particularly the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the same PSD3 haplotype was also associated with a differential functional magnetic resonance imaging signal in the PFC during a Go/No-Go task, which engages PFC-mediated executive control. Our translational analysis, therefore, suggests that PSD3 confers regional specificity to ubiquitous Arf6 in the PFC to modulate human alcohol-drinking behaviors.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate estimation of the dose of ionizing radiation to
 which individuals have been exposed is critical for
 therapeutic treatment. We investigated whether gene
 expression profiles could be used to evaluate the dose
 received, thereby serving as a biological dosimeter. We
 used cDNA microarrays to monitor changes in gene expression
 profiles induced by ionizing radiation in mouse total
 blood. The subsets of genes best characterizing each dose
 were identified by resampling the original data set and
 calculating the intersection of the dose signatures. This
 analytical strategy minimizes the impact of potential
 genetic/epigenetic variation between mice and overcomes the
 bias in gene selection inherent to microarray technology.
 The significance of the identified signatures was evaluated
 by monitoring the type I error rate by in silica negative
 control simulation. Based on the distribution of the mean
 ratios of the selected probes, we were able to identify
 transcription profiles giving 83{\%} to 100{\%} correct
 estimation of the dose received by test mice, demonstrating
 that the selected probes could be used to determine the
 dose of radiation to which the animals had been exposed.
 This method could potentially be generalized to determine
 the level of exposure to other toxins and could be used to
 develop new related clinical applications. {\textcopyright}

 of the human brain differ functionally and structurally.
 Despite over a century of research, the extent to which
 brain asymmetry is influenced by sex, handedness, age, and
 genetic factors is still controversial. Here we present the
 largest ever analysis of subcortical brain asymmetries, in
 a harmonized multi-site study using meta-analysis methods.
 Volumetric asymmetry of seven subcortical structures was
 assessed in 15,847 MRI scans from 52 datasets worldwide.
 There were sex differences in the asymmetry of the globus
 pallidus and putamen. Heritability estimates, derived from
 1170 subjects belonging to 71 extended pedigrees, revealed
 that additive genetic factors influenced the asymmetry of
 these two structures and that of the hippocampus and
 thalamus. Handedness had no detectable effect on
 subcortical asymmetries, even in this unprecedented sample
 size, but the asymmetry of the putamen varied with age.
 Genetic drivers of asymmetry in the hippocampus, thalamus
 and basal ganglia may affect variability in human
 cognition, including susceptibility to psychiatric
 disorders.},

 several doses of toxicant can lead to the same observable

 exposure prediction difficult to address. We propose a
 strategy allowing to gather the doses with similar effects
 prior to the computing of a molecular signature. The
 different gatherings of doses are compared with criteria
 based on likelihood or Monte Carlo Cross Validation. The
 molecular signature is then determined via a voting
 algorithm. Experimental results point out that the obtained
 classifier has better prediction performances than the
 classifier computed according to the original labeling.

  Abstract                 = {Integrating gene regulatory networks (GRNs) into the
 classification process of DNA microarrays is an important
 issue in bioinformatics, both because this information has
 a true biological interest and because it helps in the
 interpretation of the final classifier. We present a method
 called graph-constrained discriminant analysis (gCDA),
 which aims to integrate the information contained in one or
 several GRNs into a classification procedure. We show that
 when the integrated graph includes erroneous information,
 gCDA's performance is only slightly worse, thus showing
 robustness to misspecifications in the given GRNs. The gCDA
 framework also allows the classification process to take
 into account as many a priori graphs as there are classes
 in the dataset. The gCDA procedure was applied to simulated
 data and to three publicly available microarray datasets.
 gCDA shows very interesting performance when compared to
 state-of-the-art classification methods. The software
 package gcda, along with the real datasets that were used
 in this study, are available online:

 Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) has recruited
 and comprehensively phenotyped a rare sample of 76
 monozygotic and dizygotic twins, discordant, or concordant
 for ASD plus 30 typically developing twins. The aim of this
 letter is to complete previous descriptions of the LEAP
 case-control sample, clinically characterize, and
 investigate the suitability of the sample for ASD
 twin-control analyses purposes and share some 'lessons
 learnt.' Among the twins, a diagnosis of ASD is associated
 with increased symptom levels of ADHD, higher rates of
 intellectual disability, and lower family income. For the
 future, we conclude that the LEAP twin cohort offers
 multiple options for analyses of genetic and shared and
 non-shared environmental factors to generate new hypotheses
 for the larger cohort of LEAP singletons, but particularly
 cross-validate and refine evidence from it.},

 imaging of the thorax and abdomen, hindering the
 localization, detection of the lesions, and quantification

 the registration of PET and CT scans, even with a combined
 PET/CT scanner.Our long term goal is to study the impact of
 respiratory motion on lesion detection for FDG-PET scan. In
 this paper, we used the model proposed in the new dynamic
 MCAT phantom to simulate FDG-PET scans. In order to prepare
 the input data for the simulation, two sets of 16 temporal
 frames of the MCAT phantom were generated along a complete
 respiratory cycle. We generated an emission data set, using
 typical values of FDG uptake for each tissue, and a set of
 corresponding attenuation maps for 511 keV photons. After a
 thorough inspection of the different moving structures, we
 introduced 3 hot spherical lesions (7,10 and 12 mm
 diameter) in the liver, mediastinum and right lung,
 respectively with contrasts of 4:1, 8:1 and 13:1. We
 assumed that the liver and mediastinum approximately move
 as rigid bodies in the current phantom model. Both emission
 and attenuation data sets were input to an analytical PET
 simulator. The resulting analytical emission and
 transmission sinograms corresponding to each frame were
 averaged. Poisson noise was introduced in the emission
 projections and images were reconstructed using the
 FORE-AWOSEM algorithm, after correction for normalization
 and attenuation.The visual inspection of the images shows
 the lesions blurred and elongated in comparison with the
 images originating from a 'static' frame. We also found
 that respiratory motion may preclude the detection of the
 smallest lesion inserted in the liver.}

  Abstract                 = {Dysfunctional reward processing is implicated in various
 mental disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity
 disorder (ADHD) and addictions. Such impairments might
 involve different components of the reward process,
 including brain activity during reward anticipation. We
 examined brain nodes engaged by reward anticipation in
 1,544 adolescents and identified a network containing a
 core striatal node and cortical nodes facilitating outcome
 prediction and response preparation. Distinct nodes and
 functional connections were preferentially associated with
 either adolescent hyperactivity or alcohol consumption,
 thus conveying specificity of reward processing to
 clinically relevant behavior. We observed associations
 between the striatal node, hyperactivity, and the vacuolar
 protein sorting-associated protein 4A (VPS4A) gene in
 humans, and the causal role of Vps4 for hyperactivity was
 validated in Drosophila. Our data provide a neurobehavioral
 model explaining the heterogeneity of rewardrelated
 behaviors and generate a hypothesis accounting for their
 enduring nature.},

 misusers, including adolescent smokers, often have reduced
 reward system activity during processing of non-drug
 rewards. Using a psychophysiological interaction approach,
 we examined functional connectivity with the ventral
 striatum during reward anticipation in a large (N = 206)
 sample of adolescent smokers. Increased smoking frequency
 was associated with (1) increased connectivity with regions
 involved in saliency and valuation, including the
 orbitofrontal cortex and (2) reduced connectivity between
 the ventral striatum and regions associated with inhibition
 and risk aversion, including the right inferior frontal
 gyrus. These results demonstrate that functional
 connectivity during reward processing is relevant to
 adolescent addiction.},

 Background: The aim of the present longitudinal study was
 the psychometric evaluation of the Substance Use Risk
 Profile Scale (SURPS). Methods: We analyzed data from N =
 2,022 adolescents aged 13 to 15 at baseline assessment and
 2 years later (mean interval 2.11 years). Missing data at
 follow-up were imputed (N = 522). Psychometric properties
 of the SURPS were analyzed using confirmatory factor
 analysis. We examined structural as well as convergent
 validity with other personality measurements and drinking
 motives, and predictive validity for substance use at
 follow-up. Results: The hypothesized 4-factorial structure
 (i.e., anxiety sensitivity, hopelessness, impulsivity
 [IMP], and sensation seeking [SS] ) based on all 23 items
 resulted in acceptable fit to empirical data, acceptable
 internal consistencies, low to moderate test-retest
 reliability coefficients, as well as evidence for factorial
 and convergent validity. The proposed factor structure was
 stable for both males and females and, to lesser degree,
 across languages. However, only the SS and the IMP
 subscales of the SURPS predicted substance use outcomes at
 16 years of age. Conclusions: The SURPS is unique in its
 specific assessment of traits related to substance use
 disorders as well as the resulting shortened administration
 time. Test-retest reliability was low to moderate and
 comparable to other personality scales. However, its
 relation to future substance use was limited to the SS and
 IMP subscales, which may be due to the relatively low-risk
 substance use pattern in the present sample.},

 consistently shown to modulate the risk of Alzheimer's
 disease (AD). Here, using an AD and normal aging dataset
 primarily consisting of three AD multi-center studies (n
 1,781), we compared the effect of APOE and amyloid-$\beta$
 (A$\beta$) on baseline hippocampal volumes in AD patients,
 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, and healthy
 controls. A large sample of healthy adolescents (n 1,387)
 was also used to compared hippocampal volumes between APOE
 groups. Subjects had undergone a magnetic resonance imaging
 (MRI) scan and APOE genotyping. Hippocampal volumes were
 processed using FreeSurfer. In the AD and normal aging
 dataset, hippocampal comparisons were performed in each
 APOE group and in ϵ4 carriers with positron emission
 tomography A$\beta$ who were dichotomized
 (A$\beta$/A$\beta$-) using previous cut-offs. We found a
 linear reduction in hippocampal volumes with ϵ4 carriers
 possessing the smallest volumes, ϵ3 carriers possessing
 intermediate volumes, and ϵ2 carriers possessing the
 largest volumes. Moreover, AD and MCI ϵ4 carriers
 possessed the smallest hippocampal volumes and control ϵ2
 carriers possessed the largest hippocampal volumes.
 Subjects with both APOE ϵ4 and A$\beta$ had the lowest
 hippocampal volumes when compared to A$\beta$- ϵ4
 carriers, suggesting a synergistic relationship between
 APOE ϵ4 and A$\beta$. However, we found no hippocampal
 volume differences between APOE groups in healthy
 14-year-old adolescents. Our findings suggest that the
 strongest neuroanatomic effect of APOE ϵ4 on the
 hippocampus is observed in AD and groups most at risk of
 developing the disease, whereas hippocampi of old and young
 healthy individuals remain unaffected.},

 by attenuated activity in the brain's valuation system in
 key reward processing areas, such as the ventral striatum
 (VS), as measured with functional magnetic resonance
 imaging. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether common risk variants
 for psychosis are associated with individual variation in
 the VS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A
 cross-sectional study of a large cohort of adolescents from
 the IMAGEN study (a European multicenter study of
 reinforcement sensitivity in adolescents) was performed
 from March 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011. Data
 analysis was conducted from October 1, 2015, to January 9,
 2016. Polygenic risk profile scores (RPSs) for psychosis
 were generated for 1841 healthy adolescents. Sample size
 and characteristics varied across regression analyses,
 depending on mutual information available (N = 1524-1836).
 MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reward-related brain function
 was assessed with blood oxygen level dependency (BOLD) in
 the VS using the monetary incentive delay (MID) task,
 distinguishing reward anticipation and receipt. Behavioral
 impulsivity, IQ, MID task performance, and VS BOLD were
 regressed against psychosis RPS at 4 progressive P
 thresholds (P {\textless} .01, P {\textless} .05, P
 {\textless} .10, and P {\textless} .50 for RPS models 1-4,
 respectively). RESULTS: In a sample of 1841 healthy
 adolescents (mean age, 14.5 years; 906 boys and 935 girls),
 we replicated an association between increasing psychosis
 RPS and reduced IQ (matrix reasoning: corrected P = .003
 for RPS model 2, 0.4{\%} variance explained), supporting
 the validity of the psychosis RPS models. We also found a
 nominally significant association between increased
 psychosis RPS and reduced MID task performance (uncorrected
 P =.03 for RPS model 4, 0.2{\%} variance explained). Our
 main finding was a positive association between psychosis
 RPS and VS BOLD during reward anticipation at all 4
 psychosis RPS models and for 2 P thresholds for reward
 receipt (RPS models 1 and 3), correcting for the familywise
 error rate (0.8{\%}-1.9{\%} variance explained).
 CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings support an
 association between psychosis RPS and VS BOLD in
 adolescents. Genetic risk for psychosis may shape an
 individual's response to rewarding stimuli.},

 Polymorphisms (SNPs) covarying with a set of neuroimaging
 phenotypes derived from functional Magnetic Resonance

 multi-variate methods overfit the data, we propose a

 demonstrate that the combination of univariate filtering
 and sparse PLS outperforms all other strategies and is able
 to extract a significant link between a set of SNPs and a
 set of brain regions activated during a reading task.

  Abstract                 = {Brain imaging is increasingly recognised as an
 intermediate phenotype to understand the complex path
 between genetics and behavioural or clinical phenotypes. In
 this context, a first goal is to propose methods to
 identify the part of genetic variability that explains some
 neuroimaging variability. Classical univariate approaches
 often ignore the potential joint effects that may exist
 between genes or the potential covariations between brain
 regions. In this paper, we propose instead to investigate
 an exploratory multivariate method in order to identify a
 set of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) covarying
 with a set of neuroimaging phenotypes derived from
 functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Recently,
 Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression or Canonical
 Correlation Analysis (CCA) have been proposed to analyse
 DNA and transcriptomics. Here, we propose to transpose this
 idea to the DNA vs. imaging context. However, in very
 high-dimensional settings like in imaging genetics studies,
 such multivariate methods may encounter overfittin g
 issues. Thus we investigate the use of different strategies
 of regularisation and dimension reduction techniques
 combined with PLS or CCA to face the very high
 dimensionality of imaging genetics studies. We propose a
 comparison study of the different strategies on a simulated
 dataset first and then on a real dataset composed of 94
 subjects, around 600,000 SNPs and 34 functional MRI
 lateralisation indexes computed from reading and speech
 comprehension contrast maps. We estimate the
 generalisability of the multivariate association with a
 cross-validation scheme and demonstrate the significance of
 this link, using a permutation procedure. Univariate
 selection appears to be necessary to reduce the
 dimensionality. However, the significant association
 uncovered by this two-step approach combining univariate
 filtering and L1-regularised PLS suggests that discovering
 meaningful genetic associations calls for a multivariate
 approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

However, little is known about common genetic influences on cognitive ability and brain activation when engaged in a cognitive task. The Human Connectome Project (HCP) offers a unique opportunity to study this shared genetic etiology with an extended pedigree of 785 individuals. To investigate this common genetic origin, we took advantage of the HCP dataset, which includes both language and mathematics activation tasks. Using the HCP multimodal parcellation, we identified areals in which inter-individual functional MRI (fMRI) activation variance was significantly explained by genetics. Then, we performed bivariate genetic analyses between the neural activations and behavioral scores, corresponding to the fMRI task accuracies, fluid intelligence, working memory and language performance. We observed that several parts of the language network along the superior temporal sulcus, as well as the angular gyrus belonging to the math processing network, are significantly genetically correlated with these indicators of cognitive performance. This shared genetic etiology provides insights into the brain areas where the human-specific genetic repertoire is expressed. Studying the association of polygenic risk scores, using variants associated with human cognitive ability and brain activation, would provide an opportunity to better understand where these variants are influential.},

  Abstract                 = {The influence of genes on cortical structures has been
 assessed through various phenotypes. The sulcal pits, which
 are the putative first cortical folds, have for long been
 assumed to be under tight genetic control, but this was
 never quantified. We estimated the pit depth heritability
 in various brain regions using the high quality and large
 sample size of the Human Connectome Project pedigree
 cohort. Analysis of additive genetic variance indicated
 that their heritability ranges between 0.2 and 0.5 and
 displays a regional genetic control with an overall
 symmetric pattern between hemispheres. However, a
 noticeable asymmetry of heritability estimates is observed
 in the superior temporal sulcus and could thus be related
 to language lateralization. The heritability range
 estimated in this study reinforces the idea that cortical
 shape is determined primarily by nongenetic factors, which
 is consistent with the important increase of cortical
 folding from birth to adult life and thus predominantly
 constrained by environmental factors. Nevertheless, the
 genetic cues, implicated with various local levels of
 heritability in the formation of sulcal pits, play a
 fundamental role in the normal gyral pattern development.
 Quantifying their influence and identifying the underlying
 genetic variants would provide insight into
 neurodevelopmental disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {The asymmetry of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) has
 been identified as a species-specific feature of the human
 brain. The so-called superior temporal asymmetrical pit
 (STAP) area is observed from the last trimester of
 gestation onwards and is far less pronounced in the
 chimpanzee brain. This asymmetry is associated with more
 frequent sulcal interruptions, named plis de passage (PPs),
 leading to the irregular morphology of the left sulcus. In
 this paper, we aimed to characterize the variability,
 asymmetry, and heritability of these interruptions in the
 STS in comparison with the other main sulci. We developed
 an automated method to extract PPs across the cortex based
 on a highly reproducible grid of sulcal pits across
 individuals, which we applied to a subset of Human
 Connectome Project (HCP) subjects (N = 820). We report that
 only a few PPs across the cortex are genetically
 constrained, namely in the collateral, postcentral and
 superior temporal sulci and the calcarine fissure.
 Moreover, some PPs occur more often in one hemisphere than
 the other, namely in the precentral, postcentral,
 intraparietal sulci, as well as in both inferior and
 superior temporal sulci. Most importantly, we found that
 only the interruptions within the STAP region are both
 asymmetric and genetically constrained. Because this
 morphological pattern is located in an area of the left
 hemisphere related to speech, our results suggest
 structural constraints on the architecture of the
 linguistic network.},

This cortical shrinkage is visible on magnetic resonance images and is conveniently identified by the increased volume of cerebrospinal fluid in the sulci between two gyri. Here, we replicated this finding using the UK Biobank dataset and studied the genetic influence on these cortical features of aging. We divided all individuals genetically confirmed of British ancestry into two sub-cohorts (12,162 and 3435 subjects for discovery and replication samples, respectively). We found that the heritability of the sulcal opening ranges from 15 to 45{\%} (SE = 4.8{\%}). We identified 4 new loci that contribute to this opening, including one that also affects the sulci grey matter thickness. We identified the most significant variant (rs864736) on this locus as being an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for the KCNK2 gene. This gene regulates the immune-cell into the central nervous system (CNS) and controls the CNS inflammation, which is implicated in cortical atrophy and cognitive decline. These results expand our knowledge of the genetic contribution to cortical shrinking and promote further investigation into these variants and genes in pathological context such as Alzheimer's disease in which brain shrinkage is a key biomarker.},

  Abstract                 = {Murine models are commonly used in neuroscience to improve
 our knowledge of disease processes and to test drug
 effects. To accurately study neuroanatomy and brain
 function in small animals, histological staining and ex
 vivo autoradiography remain the gold standards to date.
 These analyses are classically performed by manually
 tracing regions of interest, which is time-consuming. For
 this reason, only a few 2D tissue sections are usually
 processed, resulting in a loss of information. We therefore
 proposed to match a 3D digital atlas with previously
 3D-reconstructed post mortem data to automatically evaluate
 morphology and function in mouse brain structures. We used
 a freely available MRI-based 3D digital atlas derived from
 C57Bl/6J mouse brain scans (9.4T). The histological and
 autoradiographic volumes used were obtained from a
 preliminary study in APP SL /PS1 M146L transgenic mice,
 models of Alzheimer's disease, and their control
 littermates (PS1 M146L ). We first deformed the original 3D
 MR images to match our experimental volumes. We then
 applied deformation parameters to warp the 3D digital atlas
 to match the data to be studied. The reliability of our
 method was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed by
 comparing atlas-based and manual segmentations in 3D. Our
 approach yields faster and more robust results than
 standard methods in the investigation of post mortem mouse
 data sets at the level of brain structures. It also
 constitutes an original method for the validation of an
 MRI-based atlas using histology and autoradiography as
 anatomical and functional references, respectively.

  Abstract                 = {During adolesceties (11 stimuli per set of emotions).
 Adolescent girls showed faster and more sensitive
 perception of facial emotions than boys. However, both
 adolescent boys and girls were most sensitive to variations
 in emotion intensity in faces combining happiness and
 sadness, and least sensitive to changes in faces comprising
 fear and anger. Furthermore, both sexes overidentified
 happiness and anger. However, the overidentification of
 happiness was stronger in boys. These findings were not
 influenced by individual differences in the level once
 social relationships become increasingly important.
 Establishing and maintaining these relationships requires
 understanding of emotional stimuli, such as facial
 emotions. A failure to adequately interpret emotional
 facial expressions has previously been associated with
 various mental disorders that emerge during adolescence.
 The current study examined sex differences in emotional
 face processing during adolescence. Participants were
 adolescents (n=1951) with a target age of 14, who completed
 a forced-choice emotion discrimination task. The stimuli
 used comprised morphed faces that contained a blend of two
 emotions in varying intensif pubertal maturation. These
 results indicate that male and female adolescents differ in
 their ability to identify emotions in morphed faces
 containing emotional blends. The findings provide
 information for clinical studies examining whether sex
 differences in emotional processing are related to sex
 differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders
 within this age group. {\textcopyright} 2013 American

 consisted of self-paced flexion/extension of the right

 putamen posterior to the anterior commissure (10 of 10
 subjects) and the globus pallidus (6 subjects), whereas the
 caudate nucleus was activated in only 3 subjects, and in a
 smaller area. Thus, performance of a simple motor task
 activated the sensorimotor territory of the basal ganglia.
 Within the putamen, there was a somatotopical organization
 of the foot and hand areas similar to that observed in
 nonhuman primates. These data suggest that functional
 magnetic resonance imaging can be used to study normal
 function of the basal ganglia and should therefore also
 allow investigation of patients with movement disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Background: The
 tremendous clinical and aetiological diversity among
 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been a
 major obstacle to the development of new treatments, as
 many may only be effective in particular subgroups.
 Precision medicine approaches aim to overcome this
 challenge by combining pathophysiologically based
 treatments with stratification biomarkers that predict
 which treatment may be most beneficial for particular
 individuals. However, so far, we have no single validated
 stratification biomarker for ASD. This may be due to the
 fact that most research studies primarily have focused on
 the identification of mean case-control differences, rather
 than within-group variability, and included small samples
 that were underpowered for stratification approaches. The
 EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) is to
 date the largest multi-centre, multi-disciplinary
 observational study worldwide that aims to identify and
 validate stratification biomarkers for ASD. Methods: LEAP
 includes 437 children and adults with ASD and 300
 individuals with typical development or mild intellectual
 disability. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, each
 participant is comprehensively characterised in terms of
 clinical symptoms, comorbidities, functional outcomes,
 neurocognitive profile, brain structure and function,
 biochemical markers and genomics. In addition, 51
 twin-pairs (of which 36 had one sibling with ASD) are
 included to identify genetic and environmental factors in
 phenotypic variability. Results: Here, we describe the
 demographic characteristics of the cohort, planned analytic
 stratification approaches, criteria and steps to validate
 candidate stratification markers, pre-registration
 procedures to increase transparency, standardisation and
 data robustness ac ross all analyses, and share some
 'lessons learnt'. A clinical characterisation of the cohort
 is given in the companion paper (Charman et al., accepted).
 Conclusion: We expect that LEAP will enable us to confirm,
 reject and refine current hypotheses of
 neurocognitive/neurobiological abnormalities, identify
 biologically and clinically meaningful ASD subgroups, and
 help us map phenotypic heterogeneity to different
 aetiologies.},

 Background Individual differences in impulsivity and early
 adversity are known to be strong predictors of adolescent
 antisocial behavior. However, the neurobiological bases of
 impulsivity and their relation to antisocial behavior and
 adversity are poorly understood. Methods Impulsivity was
 estimated with a temporal discounting task. Voxel-based
 morphometry was used to determine the brain structural
 correlates of temporal discounting in a large cohort (n =
 1830) of 14- to 15-year-old children. Mediation analysis
 was then used to determine whether the volumes of brain
 regions associated with temporal discounting mediate the
 relation between adverse life events (e.g., family
 conflict, serious accidents) and antisocial behaviors
 (e.g., precocious sexual activity, bullying, illicit
 substance use). Results Greater temporal discounting (more
 impulsivity) was associated with 1) lower volume in
 frontomedial cortex and bilateral insula and 2) greater
 volume in a subcortical region encompassing the ventral
 striatum, hypothalamus and anterior thalamus. The volume
 ratio between these cortical and subcortical regions was
 found to partially mediate the relation between adverse
 life events and antisocial behavior. Conclusions Temporal
 discounting is related to regions of the brain involved in
 reward processing and interoception. The results support a
 developmental imbalance model of impulsivity and are
 consistent with the idea that negative environmental
 factors can alter the developing brain in ways that promote
 antisocial behavior.},

 Analysis of functional images of the brain increasingly
 relies on individual anatomy of subjects. The aim is the
 construction of accurate anatomy-indexed functional
 mappings which would be of crucial importance for
 neurosurgical planning. The major difficulty relies in the
 important inter-subject structural variability of the
 cortical anatomy. In this paper, we assume that a large
 part of this variability can be overcome if more elementary
 and stable units than sulci and gyri are chosen to analyse
 cortex anatomy. Hence, we try to highlight such features
 using differential geometry. A method extracting cortical
 fold crest lines is described first. Then a morphological
 decomposition of sulci along crest lines is proposed.
 Finally, the relevance of this approach is demonstrated by
 a segmentation of central sulcus into two stable parts for
 ten subjects.},

 In this paper, we propose a robust fully non-supervised
 method dedicated to the segmentation of the brain in
 Tl-weighted MR images. The first step consists in the
 analysis of the scale-space of the histogram first and
 second derivative. We show first that the crossings in
 scale-space of trajectories of extrema of different
 derivative orders follow regular topological properties.
 These properties allow us to design a new structural
 representation of a ID signal. Then we propose an
 heuristics using this representation to infer statistics on
 grey and white matter grey level values from the histogram.
 These statistics are used by an improved morphological
 process combining two opening sizes to segment the brain.
 The method has been validated with 70 images coming from 3
 different scanners and acquired with various MR sequences.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a fully nonsupervised methodology dedicated to
 the fast registration of positron emission tomography (PET)
 and magnetic resonance images of the brain. First, discrete
 representations of the surfaces of interest (head or brain
 surface) are automatically extracted from both images.
 Then, a shape-independent surface-matching algorithm gives
 a rigid body transformation, which allows the transfer of
 information between both modalities. A three-dimensional
 (3D) extension of the chamfer-matching principle makes up
 the core of this surface-matching algorithm. The optimal
 transformation is inferred from the minimization of a
 quadratic generalized distance between discrete surfaces,
 taking into account between-modality differences in the
 localization of the segmented surfaces. The minimization
 process is efficiently performed via the precomputation of
 a 3D distance map. Validation studies using a dedicated
 brain-shaped phantom have shown that the maximum
 registration error was of the order of the PET pixel size
 (2 mm) for the wide variety of tested configurations. The
 software is routinely used today in a clinical context by
 the physicians of the Service Hospitalier Frederic Joliot (
 {\textgreater} 150 registrations performed). The entire
 registration process requires {\~{}}5 min on a conventional
 workstation.},

 This paper presents a project aiming at the automatic
 detection and recognition of the human cortical sulci in a
 3D magnetic resonance image. The two first steps of this
 project (automatic extraction of an attributed relational
 graph (ARG) representing the individual cortical
 topography, constitution of a database of labelled ARGs)
 are briefly described. Then, a probabilistic structural
 model of the cortical topography is inferred from the
 database. This model, which is a structural prototype whose
 nodes can split into pieces according to syntactic
 constraints, relies on several original interpretations of
 the inter-individual structural variability of the cortical
 topography. This prototype is endowed with a random graph
 structure taking into account this anatomical variability.
 The recognition process is formalized as a labelling
 problem whose solution, defined as the maximum a posteriori
 estimate of a Markovian random field (MRF), is obtained
 using simulated annealing.},

 highlight bottlenecks as areas of high information flow.
 This information transmission process is supposed to have a
 conservative flow which leads to the well-known
 Dirichlet-Neumann problem. This problem is solved using
 finite differences, over-relaxation and a raw to fine

 whole-body numerical rat phantom simulations, including
 3-14 organs, together with physiological movements (heart
 beating, breathing, and bladder filling). The method was
 resistant to spillover and physiological movements, while
 other methods failed to obtain a correct segmentation. The
 radioactivity concentrations calculated with this method
 also showed an excellent correlation with the manual
 delineation of organs in a large set of preclinical images.
 In addition, it was faster, detected more organs, and
 extracted organs' mean time activity curves with a better
 confidence on the measure than manual delineation.

 (FTO)-associated gene, a well-replicated gene locus of
 obesity, appear to be associated also with reduced regional
 brain volumes in elderly. Here, we examined whether FTO is
 associated with total brain volume in adolescence, thus
 exploring possible developmental effects of FTO. We studied
 a population-based sample of 598 adolescents recruited from
 the French Canadian founder population in whom we measured
 brain volume by magnetic resonance imaging. Total fat mass
 was assessed with bioimpedance and body mass index was
 determined with anthropometry. Genotype-phenotype
 associations were tested with Merlin under an additive
 model. We found that the G allele of FTO (rs9930333) was
 associated with higher total body fat [TBF (P 5 0.002) and
 lower brain volume (P 5 0.005)]. The same allele was also
 associated with higher lean body mass (P 5 0.03) and no
 difference in height (P 5 0.99). Principal component
 analysis identified a shared inverse variance between the
 brain volume and TBF, which was associated with FTO at P 5
 5.5 3 1026. These results were replicated in two
 independent samples of 413 and 718 adolescents, and in a
 meta-analysis of all three samples (n 5 1729 adolescents),
 FTO was associated with this shared inverse variance at P 5
 1.3 3 1029. Co-expression networks analysis supported the
 possibility that the underlying FTO effects may occur
 during embryogenesis. In conclusion, FTO is associated with
 shared inverse variance between body adiposity and brain
 volume, suggesting that this gene may exert inverse effects
 on adipose and brain tissues. Given the completion of the
 overall brain growth in early childhood, these effects may
 have their origins during early development.

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2014, The Author(s). Prefrontal dopamine
 levels are relatively increased in adolescence compared to
 adulthood. Genetic variation of COMT (COMT Val158Met)
 results in lower enzymatic activity and higher dopamine
 availability in Met carriers. Given the dramatic changes of
 synaptic dopamine during adolescence, it has been suggested
 that effects of COMT Val158Met genotypes might have
 oppositional effects in adolescents and adults. The present
 study aims to identify such oppositional COMT Val158Met
 effects in adolescents and adults in prefrontal brain
 networks at rest. Resting state functional connectivity
 data were collected from cross-sectional and multicenter
 study sites involving 106 healthy young adults (mean age
 24 ± 2.6 years), gender matched to 106 randomly chosen
 14-year-olds. We selected the anterior medial prefrontal
 cortex (amPFC) as seed due to its important role as nexus
 of the executive control and default mode network. We
 observed a significant age-dependent reversal of COMT
 Val158Met effects on resting state functional connectivity
 between amPFC and ventrolateral as well as dorsolateral
 prefrontal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus. Val
 homozygous adults exhibited increased and adolescents
 decreased connectivity compared to Met homozygotes for all
 reported regions. Network analyses underscored the
 importance of the parahippocampal gyrus as mediator of
 observed effects. Results of this study demonstrate that
 adolescent and adult resting state networks are
 dose-dependently and diametrically affected by COMT
 genotypes following a hypothetical model of dopamine
 function that follows an inverted U-shaped curve. This
 study might provide cues for the understanding of disease
 onset or dopaminergic treatment mechanisms in major
 neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and
 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s) In many societies, the
 majority of adults regularly consume alcohol. However, only
 a small proportion develops alcohol addiction. Individuals
 at risk often show a high sensation-seeking/low-anxiety
 behavioural phenotype. Here we asked which role EF hand
 domain containing 2 (EFhd2; Swiprosin-1) plays in the
 control of alcohol addiction-associated behaviours. EFhd2
 knockout (KO) mice drink more alcohol than controls and
 spontaneously escalate their consumption. This coincided
 with a sensation-seeking and low-anxiety phenotype. A
 reversal of the behavioural phenotype with
 $\beta$-carboline, an anxiogenic inverse benzodiazepine
 receptor agonist, normalized alcohol preference in EFhd2 KO
 mice, demonstrating an EFhd2-driven relationship between
 personality traits and alcohol preference. These findings
 were confirmed in a human sample where we observed a
 positive association of the EFhd2 single-nucleotide
 polymorphism rs112146896 with lifetime drinking and a
 negative association with anxiety in healthy adolescents.
 The lack of EFhd2 reduced extracellular dopamine levels in
 the brain, but enhanced responses to alcohol. In
 confirmation, gene expression analysis revealed reduced
 tyrosine hydroxylase expression and the regulation of genes
 involved in cortex development, Eomes and Pax6, in EFhd2 KO
 cortices. These findings were corroborated in Xenopus
 tadpoles by EFhd2 knockdown. Magnetic resonance imaging
 (MRI) in mice showed that a lack of EFhd2 reduces cortical
 volume in adults. Moreover, human MRI confirmed the
 negative association between lifetime alcohol drinking and
 superior frontal gyrus volume. We propose that EFhd2 is a
 conserved resilience factor against alcohol consumption and
 its escalation, working through Pax6/Eomes. Reduced EFhd2
 function induces high-risk personality traits of
 sensation-seeking/low anxiety associated with enhanced
 alcohol consumption, which may be related to cortex
 function.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication,

  Abstract                 = {In vivo studies of ligand-receptor interactions with PET
 data are based on different approaches that provide either
 quantitative results (receptor density and affinity) or
 indices that are assumed to be correlated with the receptor
 concentration. The aims of this study are to obtain
 parametric images of benzodiazepine receptor concentration
 and of flumazenil affinity and to study the validity of two
 receptor concentration indexes. Methods: A
 three-compartment ligand-receptor model, [ 11 C]flumazenil,
 and experimental data obtained using a three-injection
 protocol in human volunteers were used to acquire
 parametric images. The delayed activity method and the
 apparent distribution volume (estimated using a
 two-compartment model) were also tested and their results
 compared with those of the multi-injection approach.
 Results: Parametric images of receptor density, affinity
 and all kinetic parameters were obtained with acceptable
 variation coefficients. A correlation between receptor
 density and apparent affinity was found (r = 0.83; p
 {\textless} 0.0005). The correlation between receptor
 concentration and apparent distribution volume (estimated
 with three- and two-compartment models, respectively) was
 accessed using both a linear (the usual hypothesis) and a
 nonlinear correlation derived from the relationship between
 the receptor density and the affinity. Conclusion: In spite
 of the complexity of this protocol (three injections, a
 2-hr experiment, blood sampling and a metabolite study), we
 showed that the multi injection approach is suitable for
 parametric brain imaging. By using this approach as a
 reference, we deduced that the distribution volume and
 delayed activity images are valid methods in the usual
 range of the benzodiazepine receptor concentrations found
 in the human brain.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is a
 signaling complex that mediates the differentiation of
 stage-specific cell fate decisions in B lymphocytes. While
 several studies have shown differences in signal
 transduction components as being key to contrasting
 phenotypic outcomes, little is known about the differential
 BCR-triggered gene transcription downstream of the
 signaling cascades. Results: Here we define the
 transcriptional changes that underlie BCR-induced apoptosis
 and proliferation of immature and mature B cells,
 respectively. Comparative genome-wide expression profiling
 identified 24 genes that discriminated between the early
 responses of the two cell types to BCR stimulation. Using
 mice with a conditional Myc-deletion, we validated the
 microarray data by demonstrating that Myc is critical to
 promoting BCR-triggered B-cell proliferation. We further
 investigated the Myc-dependent molecular mechanisms and
 found that Myc promotes a BCR-dependent clonal expansion of
 mature B cells by inducing proliferation and inhibiting
 differentiation. Conclusion: This work provides the first
 comprehensive analysis of the early transcriptional events
 that lead to either deletion or clonal expansion of B cells
 upon antigen recognition, and demonstrates that Myc
 functions as the hub of a transcriptional network that
 control B-cell fate in the periphery. {\textcopyright} 2009

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2016 International Association for the
 Study of Pain. The processing of reward and reinforcement
 learning seems to be important determinants of pain
 chronicity. However, reward processing is already altered
 early in life and if this is related to the development of
 pain symptoms later on is not known. The aim of this study
 was first to examine whether behavioural and brain-related
 indicators of reward processing at the age of 14 to 15
 years are significant predictors of pain complaints 2 years
 later, at 16 to 17 years. Second, we investigated the
 contribution of genetic variations in the opioidergic
 system, which is linked to the processing of both, reward
 and pain, to this prediction. We used the monetary
 incentive delay task to assess reward processing, the
 Children's Somatization Inventory as measure of pain
 complaints and tested the effects of 2 single nucleotide
 polymorphisms (rs1799971/rs563649) of the human-opioid
 receptor gene. We found a significant prediction of pain
 complaints by responses in the dorsal striatum during
 reward feedback, independent of genetic predisposition. The
 relationship of pain complaints and activation in the
 periaqueductal gray and ventral striatum depended on the
 T-allele of rs563649. Carriers of this allele also showed
 more pain complaints than CC-allele carriers. Therefore,
 brain responses to reward outcomes and higher sensitivity
 to pain might be related already early in life and may thus
 set the course for pain complaints later in life, partly
 depending on a specific opioidergic genetic
 predisposition.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc.. Changes in reward
 processing have been identified as one important
 pathogenetic mechanism in alcohol addiction. The
 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in the
 brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene
 (rs6265/Val66Met) modulates the central nervous system
 activity of neurotransmitters involved in reward processing
 such as serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate. It was
 identified as crucial for alcohol consumption in healthy
 adults and, in rats, specifically related to the function
 in the striatum, a region that is commonly involved in
 reward processing. However, studies in humans on the
 association of BDNF Val66Met and reward-related brain
 functions and its role for alcohol consumption, a
 significant predictor of later alcohol addiction, are
 missing. Based on an intermediate phenotype approach, we
 assessed the early orientation toward alcohol and alcohol
 consumption in 530 healthy adolescents that underwent a
 monetary incentive delay task during functional magnetic
 resonance imaging. We found a significantly lower response
 in the putamen to reward anticipation in adolescent Met
 carriers with high versus low levels of alcohol
 consumption. During reward feedback, Met carriers with low
 putamen reactivity were significantly more likely to orient
 toward alcohol and to drink alcohol 2 years later. This
 study indicates a possible effect of BDNF Val66Met on
 alcohol addiction-related phenotypes in adolescence.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2018 There is considerable inter-individual variability in the rate at which working memory (WM) develops during childhood and adolescence, but the neural and genetic basis for these differences are poorly understood. Dopamine-related genes, striatal activation and morphology have been associated with increased WM capacity after training. Here we tested the hypothesis that these factors would also explain some of the inter-individual differences in the rate of WM development. We measured WM performance in 487 healthy subjects twice: at age 14 and 19. At age 14 subjects underwent a structural MRI scan, and genotyping of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or close to the dopamine genes DRD2, DAT-1 and COMT, which have previously been associated with gains in WM after WM training. We then analyzed which biological factors predicted the rate of increase in WM between ages 14 and 19. We found a significant interaction between putamen size and DAT1/SLC6A3 rs40184 polymorphism, such that TC heterozygotes with a larger putamen at age 14 showed greater WM improvement at age 19. The effect of the DAT1 polymorphism on WM development was exerted in interaction with striatal morphology. These results suggest that development of WM partially share neuro-physiological mechanism with training-induced plasticity.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation is important for learning and cognition.
 Although dopaminergic (D2) transmission in the ventral
 striatum (VS) is associated with motivation, learning, and
 cognition are more strongly associated with function of the
 dorsal striatum, including activation in the caudate
 nucleus. A recent study found an interaction between
 intrinsic motivation and the DRD2/ANKK1 polymorphism
 (rs1800497), suggesting that A-carriers of rs1800497 are
 significantly more sensitive to motivation in order to
 improve during working memory (WM) training. Using data
 from the two large-scale imaging genetic data sets, IMAGEN
 (n=1080, age 13-15 years) and BrainChild (n∼300, age
 6-27), we investigated whether rs1800497 is associated with
 WM. In the IMAGEN data set, we tested whether VS/caudate
 activation during reward anticipation was associated with
 WM performance and whether rs1800497 and VS/caudate
 activation interact to affect WM performance. We found that
 rs1800497 was associated with WM performance in IMAGEN and
 BrainChild. Higher VS and caudate activation during reward
 processing were significantly associated with higher WM
 performance (p {\textless} 0.0001). An interaction was
 found between the DRD2/ANKK1 polymorphism rs1800497 and VS
 activation during reward anticipation on WM (p {\textless}
 0.01), such that carriers of the minor allele (A) showed a
 significant correlation between VS activation and WM,
 whereas the GG-homozygotes did not, suggesting that the
 effect of VS BOLD on WM is modified by inter-individual
 genetic differences related to D2 dopaminergic
 transmission. {\textcopyright} 2014 American College of

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc. Moment-to-moment reaction time variability on tasks of attention, often quantified by intra-individual response variability (IRV), provides a good indication of the degree to which an individual is vulnerable to lapses in sustained attention. Increased IRV is a hallmark of several disorders of attention, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Here, task-based fMRI was used to provide the first examination of how average brain activation and functional connectivity patterns in adolescents are related to individual differences in sustained attention as measured by IRV. We computed IRV in a large sample of adolescents (n = 758) across ‘Go' trials of a Stop Signal Task (SST). A data-driven, multi-step analysis approach was used to identify networks associated with low IRV (i.e., good sustained attention) and high IRV (i.e., poorer sustained attention). Low IRV was associated with greater functional segregation (i.e., stronger negative connectivity) amongst an array of brain networks, particularly between cerebellum and motor, cerebellum and prefrontal, and occipital and motor networks. In contrast, high IRV was associated with stronger positive connectivity within the motor network bilaterally and between motor and parietal, prefrontal, and limbic networks. Consistent with these observations, a separate sample of adolescents exhibiting elevated ADHD symptoms had increased fMRI activation and stronger positive connectivity within the same motor network denoting poorer sustained attention, compared to a matched asymptomatic control sample. With respect to the functional connectivity signature of low IRV, there were no statistically significant differences in networks denoting good sustained attention between the ADHD symptom group and asymptomatic control group. We propose that sustained attentional processes are facilitated by an array of neural networks working together, and provide an empirical account of how the functional role of the cerebellum extends to cognition in adolescents. This work highlights the involvement of motor cortex in the integrity of sustained attention, and suggests that atypically strong connectivity within motor networks characterizes poor attentional capacity in both typically developing and ADHD symptomatic adolescents.},

 of mental disorders over a 2-year period, with the
 Substance Use Risk Profile Scale showing incremental
 validity over the NEO Personality Inventory. Attentional
 biases to emotional faces did not characterise or predict
 mental disorders examined in the current sample.
 Discussion: Personality traits can indicate concurrent and
 prospective risk for mental disorders in a community youth
 sample, and identify at-risk youth beyond the impact of
 baseline symptoms. This study does not support the
 hypothesis that attentional biases mediate the relationship
 between personality and psychopathology in a community
 sample. Task and sample characteristics that contribute to
 differing results among studies are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Alcohol abuse is highly prevalent, but little is
 understood about the molecular causes. Here, we report that
 Ras suppressor 1 (Rsu1) affects ethanol consumption in
 flies and humans. Drosophila lacking Rsu1 show reduced
 sensitivity to ethanol-induced sedation. We show that Rsu1
 is required in the adult nervous system for normal
 sensitivity and that it acts downstream of the integrin
 cell adhesion molecule and upstream of the Ras-related C3
 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) GTPase to regulate the
 actin cytoskeleton. In an ethanol preference assay, global
 loss of Rsu1 causes high na{\"{i}}ve preference. In
 contrast, flies lacking Rsu1 only in the mushroom bodies of
 the brain show normal na{\"{i}}ve preference but then fail
 to acquire ethanol preference like normal flies. Rsu1 is,
 thus, required in distinct neurons tomodulate na{\"{i}}ve
 and acquired ethanol preference. In humans, we find that
 polymorphisms in RSU1 are associated with brain activation
 in the ventral striatum during reward anticipation in
 adolescents and alcohol consumption in both adolescents and
 adults. Together, these data suggest a conserved role for
 integrin/Rsu1/Rac1/actin signaling in modulating
 rewardrelated phenotypes, including ethanol consumption,
 across phyla.},

 The main purpose of the present study was to analyse the
 internal structure and to test the measurement invariance
 of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ),
 self-reported version, in five European countries. The
 sample consisted of 3012 adolescents aged between 12 and
 17 years (M = 14.20; SD = 0.83). The five-factor model
 (with correlated errors added), and the five-factor model
 (with correlated errors added) with the reverse-worded
 items allowed to cross-load on the Prosocial subscale,
 displayed adequate goodness of-fit indices. Multi-group
 confirmatory factor analysis showed that the five-factor
 model (with correlated errors added) had partial strong
 measurement invariance by countries. A total of 11 of the
 25 items were non-invariant across samples. The level of
 internal consistency of the Total difficulties score was
 0.84, ranging between 0.69 and 0.78 for the SDQ subscales.
 The findings indicate that the SDQ's subscales need to be
 modified in various ways for screening emotional and
 behavioural problems in the five European countries that
 were analysed.},

 11 C]raclopride, changes in striatal extracellular dopamine
 concentration during a rewarded effortful task. This
 approach aimed to increase the sensitivity in detection of
 these effects. It requires a single-dynamic PET study and
 combines the classic kinetic compartmental model with the
 general linear model of SPM to provide statistical
 inference on changes in [ 11 C]raclopride time-activity
 curve due to endogenous dopamine release during two short
 periods of activation. Kinetic simulations predicted that
 100{\%} dopamine increase during two 5-min periods starting
 at 30 and 60 min after the injection can be detected.
 Moreover the effects of dopamine release on the [ 11
 C]raclopride time-activity-curve are different from those
 induced by CBF increase. These simulated curves were used
 to construct the statistical linear model and to test
 voxel-by-voxel in healthy subjects the hypothesis that
 dopamine is released in the ventral striatum during periods
 of unexpected monetary gains, but not during periods of
 unexpected monetary loss. The experimental results are in
 line with the expected results although the amplitude of
 the effects due to dopamine release is moderate. The
 advantages and the limits of this method as well as the
 relevance of the results for dopamine involvement in reward
 processing are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier

 Purpose: The onset of substance use mostly occurs during
 adolescence. The aim of the present study is to investigate
 the relevance of personality on the basis of the
 NEO-Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) to future experiences
 with tobacco, alcohol and cannabis. Methods: The test data
 were derived from the baseline assessment and first
 follow-up of the IMAGEN study, a European multicenter and
 multidisciplinary research project on adolescent mental
 health. In the present study 1004 participants were tested.
 The characterization of personality was conducted with the
 NEO-FFI at the age of 14 (T1). The data on substance use
 were collected with the European School Survey Project on
 Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) questionnaire at the age of
 16 (T2). For the statistical analysis, t-tests and
 univariate analyses of variance were performed. Results:
 The scores of Conscientiousness at T1 were significantly
 lower for adolescents with tobacco, alcohol and cannabis
 experiences at T2. We found lower scores of Agreeableness
 at T1 in participants with tobacco and cannabis use at T2.
 Extraversion at T1 was significantly higher for adolescents
 with smoking experiences at T2. No significant associations
 between Neuroticism or Openness and future substance use
 were observed. Conclusion: Low scores of Conscientiousness
 and Agreeableness seem to have the greatest value for a
 prediction of later experiences with substance use. As the
 present study is the first one to examine the predictive
 value of the NEO-FFI for future substance use in an
 adolescent sample, further studies are necessary to enable
 a better applicability in a clinical context.},

 Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has
 become an established research tool for the investigation
 of tissue structure and orientation. In this paper, we are
 interested in the connectivity induced by white matter
 fibers in the living human brain. Considering the data
 resolution, this question has to be addressed at the level
 of fascicles made up by a bunch of parallel fibers. We
 propose first an algorithm dedicated to the fascicle
 tracking in a direction map inferred from diffusion data.
 This algorithm takes into account the usual fan shaped
 merge of several fascicles in one larger bundle. Then, we
 propose a way of inferring a regularized direction map from
 diffusion data in order to get a robust tracking. The
 regularization stems from a priori knowledge on the white
 matter geometry embedded in a model of the bending energy
 of an equivalent spaghetti plate. Finally, we propose a
 study of the tracking behaviour according to the weight
 given to the regularization and some examples of the
 tracking results with real data.},

 embedded in a model of the bending energy of a spaghetti

 into account potential fan shaped junctions between

 We propose a new way for tracking brain white matter fiber
 bundles in diffusion tensor maps. Diffusion maps provide
 information about mobility of water protons in different
 directions. Assuming that diffusion is more important along
 axons, this information could lead to the direction of
 fiber bundles in white matter. Nevertheless, protocoles for
 diffusion image acquisition suffer from low resolutions and
 instrument noise. This paper is essentially dedicated to
 the design of a Markovian model aiming at the
 regularization of direction maps, and at the tracking of
 fiber bundles. Results are presented on synthetic tensor
 images to confirm the efficiency of the method. Then, white
 matter regions are regularized in order to enable the
 tracking of fiber bundles, which is of increasing interest
 in functional connectivity studies.},

 We propose a new way of embedding shape distributions in a
 topological deformable template. These distributions rely
 on global shape descriptors corresponding to the 3D moment
 invariants. In opposition to usual Fourier-like
 descriptors, they can be updated during deformations at a
 relatively low cost. The moment-based distributions are
 included in a framework allowing the management of several
 simultaneously deforming objects. This framework is
 dedicated to the segmentation of brain deep nuclei in 3D MR
 images. The paper focuses on the learning of the shape
 distributions, on the initialization of the topological
 model and on the multi-resolution energy minimization
 process. Results are presented showing the segmentation of
 twelve brain deep structures.},

 F]Fluoro-L-Dopa ( 18 F-Dopa) remains the gold standard for
 assessing dysfunctionality concerning the dopaminergic
 nigrostriatal pathway in Parkinson's disease and related
 disorders. The use of ligands of the dopamine transporters
 (DAT) is an attractive alternative target; consequently,
 the current aim was to validate one of them, 11 C-PE2I,
 using a multiinjection modeling approach allowing accurate
 quantitation of DAT densities in the striatum. Experiments
 were performed in three controls, three MPTP-treated
 (parkinsonian) baboons, and one reserpine-treated baboon.
 11 C-PE2I B'max values obtained with this approach were
 compared with 18 F-Dopa input rate constant values (Ki), in
 vitro B'max binding of 125 I-PE2I, and the number of
 dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra estimated
 postmortem by stereology. In the caudate nucleus and
 putamen, control values for 11 C-PE2I B'max were 673 and
 658 pmol/mL, respectively, whereas it was strongly reduced
 in the MPTP-treated (B'max = 26 and 36 pmol/mL) and
 reserpine-treated animals (B'max = 338 and 483 pmol/mL). In
 vivo 11 C-PE2I B'max values correlated with 18 F-Dopa Ki
 values and in vitro 125 I-PE2I Bmax values in the striatum
 and with the number of nigral dopaminergic neurons.
 Altogether, these data support the use of 11 C-PE2I for
 monitoring striatal dopaminergic disorders and the effect
 of potential neuroprotective strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective: The authors sought to explore how conduct,
 hyperactivity/inattention, and emotional symptoms are
 associated with neural reactivity to social-emotional
 stimuli, and the extent to which psychosocial stress
 modulates these relationships. Method: Participants were
 community adolescents recruited as part of the European
 IMAGEN study. Bilateral amygdala regions of interest were
 used to assess the relationship between the three
 symptomdomains and functionalMRI neural reactivity during
 passive viewing of dynamic angry and neutral facial
 expressions. Exploratory functional connectivity and whole
 brain multiple regression approaches were used to analyze
 how the symptoms and psychosocial stress relate to other
 brain regions. Results: In response to the social-emotional
 stimuli, adolescents with high levels of conduct or
 hyperactivity/ inattention symptoms who had also
 experienced a greater number of stressful life events
 showed hyperactivity of the amygdala and several regions
 across the brain. This effect was not observed with
 emotional symptoms. A cluster in the midcingulate was found
 to be common to both conduct problems and hyperactivity
 symptoms. Explo ratory functional connectivity analyses
 suggested that amygdalaprecuneus connectivity is associated
 with hyperactivity/ inattention symptoms. Conclusions: The
 results link hyperactive amygdala responses and regions
 critical for top-down emotional processing with high levels
 of psychosocial stress in individuals with greater conduct
 and hyperactivity/inattention symptoms. This work
 highlights the importance of studying how psychosocial
 stress affects functional brain responses to
 social-emotional stimuli, particularly in adolescents with
 externalizing symptoms.},

  Abstract                 = {The great variability of cerebral cortical folding
 patterns raises major problems for the systematic study of
 functional-structural relationships. This paper describes a
 novel perspective for explaining this variability, a
 perspective that relies on gyri buried in the depth of the
 sulci. From this perspective we propose a generic model of
 folding, based on indivisible units, called sulcal roots,
 which correspond to the first folding locations during
 antenatal life. These units are organized according to a
 basic scheme allowing us to describe the cortical surface
 using a system of meridians and parallels. This scheme is
 thought to be stable across individuals at the fetal stage,
 and may be related to the protomap model. Variability at
 the adult stage is thought to result from the chaotic
 behavior of the folding process: inter-individual
 differences in cortical areas can lead to qualitatively
 different folding patterns. We have tested the capacity of
 this model to match actual cortical anatomy with a database
 of magnetic resonance images of 20 normal subjects, using
 new three-dimensional visualization tools giving access to
 shapes buried in the cortex.},

 Aim: Stressful life events and individual stress experience
 are important risk factors for the development of physical
 and mental disorders. One of the modulating factors
 determining interindividual differences in stress
 experience is the person's gender. In the current study, we
 investigated sex-related differences in the frequency and
 perception of stressful life events during adolescence, a
 period characterized by particularly high stress levels.
 Subject and methods: We examined 1,657 14-year-old
 adolescents who were recruited as part of the IMAGEN study,
 a European multicenter research project on mental
 well-being of young people. For the detection of stressful
 life events, we used the Life Events Questionnaire, a
 highly valid instrument for testing common stressful events
 during adolescence. Results: Although boys and girls did
 not differ significantly regarding the total amount of
 stressful life events, girls reported more stressful events
 in the familial and body-related areas, whereas boys
 experienced more conflicts with superiors and
 independence-marking events. As regards valence, girls
 reported greater psychological distress compared to boys;
 however, in all significant results, the effect sizes were
 only small to moderate. Conclusion: While previous research
 highlighted severe stressors in adult samples, we
 investigated for the first time adolescents with a broader
 scope of stressful events. The observed differences in the
 stress experience may contribute to explain the
 sex-dependent variations in the incidence of stress-related
 disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {To assess the efficacy of fetal mesencephalic grafts in
 Parkinson's disease, it is important to know if the grafted
 cells survive and are functional. Positron emission
 tomography (PET) and {\{} 18 F{\}}fluorodopa ({\{} 18
 F{\}}dopa) have been used to demonstrate the survival of
 the grafted cells, but the relationship of {\{} 18
 F{\}}dopa uptake changes in the grafted striatum to motor
 function remains unclear. We investigated this question
 with 16 serial PET scan in 5 severe parkinsonian patients
 unilaterally grafted in whom we found a significant and
 progressive increase of the {\{} 18 F{\}}dopa uptake in the
 grafted putamen. The number of patients was too small to
 assess the sensitivity of {\{} 18 F{\}}dopa PET scans in
 individual patients. Yet, by analyzing the 16 serial PET
 scans we found a correlation between the {\{} 18 F{\}}dopa
 uptake (K i ) in the grafted putamen and the percentage of
 daily time spent “on,” suggesting that K i changes have
 a functional meaning. In addition, the K i values were
 correlated with the contralateral finger dexterity to the
 same extent in both the grafted and nongrafted putamen.
 These results indicate that {\{} 18 F{\}}dopa uptake
 reflects the motor function of the opposite side of the
 body, similarly in the grafted and ungrafted putamen, at
 least in terms of these tasks. Finally, extrapolating from
 these correlations offers the suggestion that clinical
 optimal results of the graft could be achieved if the graft
 brings the K i values in the putamen to about two standard
 deviations of mean control values. Copyright

 through the detection of a road-like network from a noisy
 set of segments extracted from an image during a
 preprocessing step. Linking segments are added to this set
 to recover lost road parts. The whole segment set is
 organized in a relational graph and the road network
 restoration is modeled as a labeling process. The solution
 is defined as the labeling maximizing a Gibbs distribution
 constructed from a set of local costs computed for each
 graph clique. These cost functions, corresponding to
 interaction potentials, are learned automatically using
 multi-layer perceptrons. Supervised learning is performed
 over a training data set using only binary teaching output,

 neural networks are used to overcome the problem of the

 extracted from the data to build a "feature graph" with
 structural relations. The goal is to endow each feature
 with a label representing either a specific object

 contextual constraints have to be respected during this
 labelling. They are modelled by Markovian potentials
 assigned to the labellings of "feature clusters". The
 solution of the labelling problem is the minimum of the
 energy defined by the sum of the local potentials. This
 paper develops a method for learning these local potentials

 Hoechst staining followed by flow cytometry, from adult
 mouse bone marrow, male adult germinal cells, muscle
 primary culture, and mesenchymal cells. These SP cells have
 been proposed to be a "stem-like" population and are used
 here as a "model" that may reveal mechanisms which would be
 relevant for a better understanding of stem cell
 properties. Transcriptional profiles for SP and the more
 differentiated non-SP cells isolated from the four tissues
 were compared by hybridization on microarray using a common
 external reference. Among the 503 genes differentially
 expressed, which discriminate SP and non-SP cells in all
 the tissues, the genes upregulated in SP cells are
 implicated in the quiescent status of the cells, the
 maintenance of their pluripotency and the capacity to
 undergo asymmetric division. These genes may be responsible
 for the decision for self-renewal of these cells, whereas
 the repression of lineage-affiliated genes in SP cells
 could be responsible for their undifferentiated state.
 These genes, acting in concert, may be the key players that
 mediate the mechanisms that control stem cell functions,
 and our results suggest that we have identified common
 "stemness functions" of these "stem-like" cells.

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Association for Child and Adolescent
 Mental Health. Background: Nociceptin is a key regulator
 linking environmental stress and alcohol drinking. In a
 genome-wide methylation analysis, we recently identified an
 association of a methylated region in the OPRL1 gene with
 alcohol-use disorders. Methods: Here, we investigate the
 biological basis of this observation by analysing
 psychosocial stressors, methylation of the OPRL1 gene,
 brain response during reward anticipation and alcohol
 drinking in 660 fourteen-year-old adolescents of the IMAGEN
 study. We validate our findings in marchigian sardinian
 (msP) alcohol-preferring rats that are genetically selected
 for increased alcohol drinking and stress sensitivity.
 Results: We found that low methylation levels in intron 1
 of OPRL1 are associated with higher psychosocial stress and
 higher frequency of binge drinking, an effect mediated by
 OPRL1 methylation. In individuals with low methylation of
 OPRL1, frequency of binge drinking is associated with
 stronger BOLD response in the ventral striatum during
 reward anticipation. In msP rats, we found that stress
 results in increased alcohol intake and decreased
 methylation of OPRL1 in the nucleus accumbens. Conclusions:
 Our findings describe an epigenetic mechanism that helps to
 explain how psychosocial stress influences risky alcohol
 consumption and reward processing, thus contributing to the
 elucidation of biological mechanisms underlying risk for
 substance abuse.},

 is substantial, but monozygotic twin discordance indicates
 a role for nonheritable differences that could be mediated
 by epigenetics. Despite growing evidence associating
 epigenetics and psychiatric disorders, it is unclear how
 epigenetics, particularly DNA methylation, relate to brain
 function and behavior, including drinking behavior. Method:
 The authors carried out a genome-wide analysis of DNA
 methylation of 18 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for
 alcohol use disorder and validated differentially
 methylated regions. After validation, the authors
 characterized these differentially methylated regions using
 personality trait assessment and functional MRI in a sample
 of 499 adolescents. Results: Hypermethylation in the
 3:-protein-phosphatase-1G (PPM1G) gene locus was associated
 with alcohol use disorder. The authors found association of
 PPM1Ghypermethylation with early escalation of alcohol use
 and increased impulsiveness. They also observed association
 of PPM1G hypermethylation with increased
 blood-oxygen-level-dependent response in the right
 subthalamic nucleus during an impulsiveness task.
 Conclusions: Overall, the authors provide first evidence
 for an epigenetic marker associated with alcohol
 consumption and its underlying neurobehavioral phenotype.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2017 the authors. The nicotinic system
 plays an important role in cognitive control and is
 implicated in several neuropsychiatric conditions. However,
 the contributions of genetic variability in this system to
 individuals' cognitive control abilities are poorly
 understood and the brain processes that mediate such
 genetic contributions remain largely unidentified. In this
 first large-scale neuroimaging genetics study of the human
 nicotinic receptor system (two cohorts, males and females,
 fMRI total N = 1586, behavioral total N = 3650), we
 investigated a common polymorphism of the high-affinity
 nicotinic receptor $\alpha$4$\beta$2 (rs1044396 on the
 CHRNA4 gene) previously implicated in behavioral and
 nicotine-related studies (albeit with inconsistent
 major/minor allele impacts). Based on our prior
 neuroimaging findings, we expected this polymorphism to
 affect neural activity in the cingulo-opercular (CO)
 network involved in core cognitive control processes
 including maintenance of alertness. Consistent across the
 cohorts, all cortical areas of the CO network showed higher
 activity in heterozygotes compared with both types of
 homozygotes during cognitive engagement. This inverted
 U-shaped relation reflects an overdominant effect; that is,
 allelic interaction (cumulative evidence p = 1.33 * 10 −5
 ). Furthermore, heterozygotes performed more accurately in
 behavioral tasks that primarily depend on sustained
 alertness. No effects were observed for haplotypes of the
 surrounding CHRNA4 region, supporting a true overdominant
 effect at rs1044396. As a possible mechanism, we observed
 that this polymorphism is an expression quantitative trait
 locus modulating CHRNA4 expression levels. This is the
 first report of overdominance in the nicotinic system.
 These findings connect CHRNA4 genotype, CO network
 activation, and sustained alertness, providing insights
 into how genetics shapes individuals' cognitive control
 abilities.},

 (upper, middle and lower), which were easily identifiable
 by morphological criteria and sharply interconnected in the
 reconstructed CS. These morphological regions appear to
 have a strong functional significance, since the middle
 region corresponded precisely to the 'hand area', as
 verified by hand vibration positron emission tomography
 activation studies in eight cases. These data suggest that
 the 3D anatomy of the cerebral cortex may facilitate sulcal
 recognition, and sulcal subdivision into smaller

  Abstract                 = {Summary: The mechanism of interictal glucose
 hypometabolism remains unclear, but this abnormality occurs
 more frequently in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) than in
 other types of partial epilepsy. Therefore temporal
 hypometabolism has been suggested to reflect mesial
 temporal sclerosis (MTS). To investigate this, we selected
 22 patients with refractory partial epilepsy of mesial
 temporal lobe origin (MTLE) who had hippocampal atrophy
 based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetric
 analysis. We then analyzed the metabolic correlates of
 unilateral hippocampal atrophy. Thirteen temporal regions
 of interest (ROI) were defined on MRI scans for each
 individual and then applied to high‐resolution
 FDG‐positron emission tomography (PET) images obtained
 parallel to the long axis of the hippocampus. The most
 hypometabolic regions were the temporal pole and the
 hippocampal region. When we analyzed ensembles of temporal
 regions grouped into related networks, the temporolimbic
 network, which included the hippocampal region and the
 temporal pole, was abnormal in 95{\%} of the patients at a
 3‐SD threshold. PET hypometabolism was highly correlated
 with the degree of hippocampal atrophy in this network, but
 not in other parts of the temporal lobe, which were less
 frequently hypometabolic. These data indicate that
 hypometabolism is a consequence of MTS in the temporolimbic
 region but not necessarily in the other parts of the
 temporal lobe. Our results also suggest that the
 combination of PET and MRI may facilitate the noninvasive
 diagnosis of MTLE. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995, Wiley

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Society for the Study of Addiction. Abnormalities across different domains of neuropsychological functioning may constitute a risk factor for heavy drinking during adolescence and for developing alcohol use disorders later in life. However, the exact nature of such multi-domain risk profiles is unclear, and it is further unclear whether these risk profiles differ between genders. We combined longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses on the large IMAGEN sample (N ≈ 1000) to predict heavy drinking at age 19 from gray matter volume as well as from psychosocial data at age 14 and 19-for males and females separately. Heavy drinking was associated with reduced gray matter volume in 19-year-olds' bilateral ACC, MPFC, thalamus, middle, medial and superior OFC as well as left amygdala and anterior insula and right inferior OFC. Notably, this lower gray matter volume associated with heavy drinking was stronger in females than in males. In both genders, we observed that impulsivity and facets of novelty seeking at the age of 14 and 19, as well as hopelessness at the age of 14, are risk factors for heavy drinking at the age of 19. Stressful life events with internal (but not external) locus of control were associated with heavy drinking only at age 19. Personality and stress assessment in adolescents may help to better target counseling and prevention programs. This might reduce heavy drinking in adolescents and hence reduce the risk of early brain atrophy, especially in females. In turn, this could additionally reduce the risk of developing alcohol use disorders later in adulthood.},

 findings suggest cannabis use in early adolescence is
 associated with hypersensitivity to signals of threat.
 Hypersensitivity to negative affect in adolescence may
 place the subject at-risk for mood disorders in adulthood.},

 Background: The mesolimbic dopamine system, composed
 primarily of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental
 area that project to striatal structures, is considered to
 be the key mediator of reinforcement-related mechanisms in
 the brain. Prompted by a genome-wide association
 meta-analysis implicating the Ras-specific guanine
 nucleotide-releasing factor 2 (RASGRF2) gene in the
 regulation of alcohol intake in men, we have recently shown
 that male Rasgrf2 –/– mice exhibit reduced ethanol
 intake and preference accompanied by a perturbed mesolimbic
 dopamine system. We therefore propose that these mice
 represent a valid model to further elucidate the precise
 genes and mechanisms regulating mesolimbic dopamine
 functioning. Methods: Transcriptomic data from the nucleus
 accumbens (NAcc) of maleRasgrf2 –/– mice and wild-type
 controls were analyzed by weighted gene coexpression
 network analysis (WGCNA). We performed follow-up genetic
 association tests in humans using a sample of male
 adolescents from the IMAGEN study characterized for binge
 drinking (n = 905) and ventral striatal activation during
 an fMRI reward task (n = 608). Results: The WGCNA analyses
 using accumbal transcriptomic data revealed 37 distinct
 “modules,” or functionally related groups of genes. Two
 of these modules were significantly associated with Rasgrf2
 knockout status: M5 (p {\textless} 0.001) and M6 (p
 {\textless} 0.001). In follow-up translational analyses we
 found that human orthologues for the M5 module were
 significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) enriched with genetic
 association signals for binge drinking in male adolescents.
 Furthermore, the most significant locus, originating from
 the EH-domain containing 4 (EHD4) gene (p {\textless}
 0.001), was also significantly associated with altered
 ventral striatal activity in male adolescents performing an
 fMRI reward task (p empirical {\textless} 0.001).
 Limitations: It was not possible to determine the extent to
 which the M5 module was dysregulated in Rasgrf2 –/–
 mice by perturbed mesolimbic dopamine signalling or by the
 loss of Rasgrf2 function in the NAcc. Conclusion: Taken
 together, our findings indicate that the accumbal M5
 module, initially identified as being dysregulated in male
 Rasgrf2 –/– mice, is also relevant for human
 alcohol-related phenotypes potentially through the
 modulation of reinforcement mechanisms in the NAcc. We
 therefore propose that the genes comprising this module
 represent important candidates for further elucidation
 within the context of alcohol-related phenotypes.},

 may be associated with superior cognitive performance. In
 this study, we test the hypothesis that manic symptoms in
 youth separate along two correlated dimensions and that a
 symptom constellation of high energy and cheerfulness is
 associated with superior cognitive performance. Method We
 studied 1755 participants of the IMAGEN study, of average
 age 14.4 years (SD = 0.43), 50.7{\%} girls. Manic symptoms
 were assessed using the Development and Wellbeing
 Assessment by interviewing parents and young people.
 Cognition was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence
 Scale For Children (WISC-IV) and a response inhibition
 task. Results Manic symptoms in youth formed two correlated
 dimensions: one termed exuberance, characterized by high
 energy and cheerfulness and one of undercontrol with
 distractibility, irritability and risk-taking behavior.
 Only the undercontrol, but not the exuberant dimension, was
 independently associated with measures of psychosocial
 impairment. In multivariate regression models, the
 exuberant, but not the undercontrolled, dimension was
 positively and significantly associated with verbal IQ by
 both parent- and self-report; conversely, the
 undercontrolled, but not the exuberant, dimension was
 associated with poor performance in a response inhibition
 task. Conclusions Our findings suggest that manic symptoms
 in youth may form dimensions with distinct correlates. The
 results are in keeping with previous findings about
 superior performance associated with mania. Further
 research is required to study etiological differences
 between these symptom dimensions and their implications for
 clinical practice.},

 There is a growing need to analyze datasets characterized
 by several sets of variables observed on a single set of
 observations. Such complex but structured dataset are known
 as multiblock dataset, and their analysis requires the
 development of new and flexible tools. For this purpose,
 Kernel Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (KGCCA)
 is proposed and offers a general framework for multiblock
 data analysis taking into account an a priori graph of
 connections between blocks. It appears that KGCCA subsumes,
 with a single monotonically convergent algorithm, a
 remarkably large number of well-known and new methods as
 particular cases. KGCCA is applied to a simulated 3-block
 dataset and a real molecular biology dataset that combines
 Gene Expression data, Comparative Genomic Hybridization
 data and a qualitative phenotype measured for a set of 53
 children with glioma. KGCCA is available on CRAN as part of
 the RGCCA package.},

  Abstract                 = {Regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis
 (RGCCA) is a generalization of regularized canonical
 correlation analysis to 3 or more sets of variables. RGCCA
 is a component-based approach which aims to study the
 relationships between several sets of variables. The
 quality and interpretability of the RGCCA components are
 likely to be affected by the usefulness and relevance of
 the variables in each block. Therefore, it is an important
 issue to identify within each block which subsets of
 significant variables are active in the relationships
 between blocks. In this paper, RGCCA is extended to address
 the issue of variable selection. Specifically, sparse
 generalized canonical correlation analysis (SGCCA) is
 proposed to combine RGCCA with an {\$}\backslashell
 1{\$}-penalty in a unified framework. Within this
 framework, blocks are not necessarily fully connected,
 which makes SGCCA a flexible method for analyzing a wide
 variety of practical problems. Finally, the versatility and

 (ENIGMA) Consortium is a collaborative network of
 researchers working together on a range of large-scale
 studies that integrate data from 70 institutions worldwide.
 Organized into Working Groups that tackle questions in
 neuroscience, genetics, and medicine, ENIGMA studies have
 analyzed neuroimaging data from over 12,826 subjects. In
 addition, data from 12,171 individuals were provided by the
 CHARGE consortium for replication of findings, in a total
 of 24,997 subjects. By meta-analyzing results from many
 sites, ENIGMA has detected factors that affect the brain
 that no individual site could detect on its own, and that
 require larger numbers of subjects than any individual
 neuroimaging study has currently collected. ENIGMA's first
 project was a genome-wide association study identifying
 common variants in the genome associated with hippocampal
 volume or intracranial volume. Continuing work is exploring
 genetic associations with subcortical volumes (ENIGMA2) and
 white matter microstructure (ENIGMA-DTI). Working groups
 also focus on understanding how schizophrenia, bipolar
 illness, major depression and attention
 deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affect the brain. We
 review the current progress of the ENIGMA Consortium, along
 with challenges and unexpected discoveries made on the way.

 Random Effect (RFX) group statistics when analyzing a very
 large cohort and the possible improvement brought from
 anatomical information. Using 1326 subjects from the IMAGEN
 study, we first give a global picture of the evolution of
 the group effect t-value from a simple face-watching
 contrast with increasing cohort size. We obtain a wide
 activated pattern, far from being limited to the reasonably
 expected brain areas, illustrating the difference between
 statistical significance and practical significance. This
 motivates us to inject tissue-probability information into
 the group estimation, we model the BOLD contrast using a
 matter-weighted mixture of Gaussians and compare it to the
 common, single-Gaussian model. In both cases, the model
 parameters are estimated per-voxel for one subgroup, and
 the likelihood of both models is computed on a second,
 separate subgroup to reflect model generalization capacity.
 Various group sizes are tested, and significance is
 asserted using a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. We
 conclude that adding matter information consistently
 improves the quantitative analysis of BOLD responses in
 some areas of the brain, particularly those where accurate
 inter-subject registration remains challenging.

 inheritable: genetic factors may explain up to 80{\%} of
 its variability. Prior studies have tried to detect genetic
 variants with a large effect on neuroanatomical diversity,
 but those currently identified account for {\textless}5{\%}
 of the variance. Here, based on our analyses of
 neuroimaging and whole-genome genotyping data from 1765
 subjects, we show that up to 54{\%} of this heritability is
 captured by large numbers of single-nucleotide
 polymorphisms of small-effect spread throughout the genome,
 especially within genes and close regulatory regions. The
 genetic bases of neuroanatomical diversity appear to be
 relatively independent of those of body size (height), but
 shared with those of verbal intelligence scores. The study
 of this genomic architecture should help us better
 understand brain evolution and disease.Molecular Psychiatry

  Abstract                 = {Three-dimensional (3D) positron emission tomog-raphy (PET)
 is attractive for [ 18 F]fluoro-DOPA studies, since the
 sensitivity improvement is maximal for radioactive sources
 located in central planes, which is usually the case for
 the human striata. However, the image quantitation in that
 mode must be assessed because of the nearly threefold
 increase in scattered coincidences. We report the results
 of [ 18 F]fluoro-DOPA studies performed on six normal
 volunteers. Each one was scanned in the 3D and
 two-dimensional (2D) modes on the same tomograph. The
 quantitation in the 3D and 2D modes was compared for a
 Patlak graphical analysis with the occipital counts as the
 input function (Ki) and a striatooccipital ratio analysis.
 We find that, in 3D PET, a scatter correction is required
 to preserve the same quantitation as in 2D PET. When the 3D
 data sets are corrected for scatter, the quantitation of
 the [ 18 F]fluoro-DOPA uptake, using the Patlak analysis,
 is similar in the 2D and 3D acquisition modes. Conversely,
 analysis of the striatooccipital ratio leads to higher
 values in 3D PET because of a better in-plane resolution.
 Finally, using the 3D mode, the dose injected to the
 subjects can be reduced by a factor greater than 1.5
 without any loss in accuracy compared to the 2D mode.

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Academy of Child and
 Adolescent Psychiatry. Objective Neuroimaging findings have
 been reported in regions of the brain associated with
 emotion in both adults and adolescents with depression, but
 few studies have investigated whether such brain
 alterations can be detected in adolescents with
 subthreshold depression, a condition at risk for major
 depressive disorder. In this study, we searched for
 differences in brain structure at age 14 years in
 adolescents with subthreshold depression and their relation
 to depression at age 16 years. Method High-resolution
 structural magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess
 adolescents with self-reported subthreshold depression (n =
 119) and healthy control adolescents (n = 461), all
 recruited from a community-based sample. Regional gray and
 white matter volumes were compared across groups using
 whole-brain voxel-based morphometry. The relationship
 between subthreshold depression at baseline and depression
 outcome was explored using causal mediation analyses to
 search for mediating effects of regional brain volumes.
 Results Adolescents with subthreshold depression had
 smaller gray matter volume in the ventromedial prefrontal
 and rostral anterior cingulate cortices and caudates, and
 smaller white matter volumes in the anterior limb of
 internal capsules, left forceps minor, and right cingulum.
 In girls, but not in boys, the relation between
 subthreshold depression at baseline and high depression
 score at follow-up was mediated by medial-prefrontal gray
 matter volume. Conclusion Subthreshold depression in early
 adolescence might be associated with smaller gray and white
 matter volumes in regions of the frontal-striatal-limbic
 affective circuit, and the occurrence of depression in
 girls with subthreshold depression might be influenced by
 medial-prefrontal gray matter volume. However, these
 findings should be interpreted with caution because of the
 limitations of the clinical assessment methods.},

  Abstract                 = {A comprehensive account of the causes of alcohol misuse
 must accommodate individual differences in biology,
 psychology and environment, and must disentangle cause and
 effect. Animal models can demonstrate the effects of
 neurotoxic substances; however, they provide limited
 insight into the psycho-social and higher cognitive factors
 involved in the initiation of substance use and progression
 to misuse. One can search for pre-existing risk factors by
 testing for endophenotypic biomarkers in non-using
 relatives; however, these relatives may have personality or
 neural resilience factors that protect them from developing
 dependence. A longitudinal study has potential to identify
 predictors of adolescent substance misuse, particularly if
 it can incorporate a wide range of potential causal
 factors, both proximal and distal, and their influence on
 numerous social, psychological and biological mechanisms.
 Here we apply machine learning to a wide range of data from
 a large sample of adolescents (n = 692) to generate models
 of current and future adolescent alcohol misuse that
 incorporate brain structure and function, individual
 personality and cognitive differences, environmental
 factors (including gestational cigarette and alcohol
 exposure), life experiences, and candidate genes. These
 models were accurate and generalized to novel data, and
 point to life experiences, neurobiological differences and
 personality as important antecedents of binge drinking. By
 identifying the vulnerability factors underlying individual
 differences in alcohol misuse, these models shed light on
 the aetiology of alcohol misuse and suggest targets for
 prevention. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers

 Catecholamine-0-methyl-transferase (COMT) gene variation
 effects on prefrontal blood oxygenation-level-dependent
 (BOLD) activation are robust; however, despite observations
 that COMT is estrogenically catabolized, sex differences in
 its prefrontal repercussions remain unclear. Here, in a
 large sample of healthy adolescents stratified by sex and
 Val 158 Met genotype (n=1133), we examine BOLD responses
 during performance of the stop-signal task in
 right-hemispheric prefrontal regions fundamental to
 inhibitory control. A significant sex-by-genotype
 interaction was observed in pre-SMA during
 successful-inhibition trials and in both pre-SMA and
 inferior frontal cortex during failed-inhibition trials
 with Val homozygotes displaying elevated activation
 compared with other genotypes in males but not in females.
 BOLD activation in the same regions significantly mediated
 the relationship between COMT genotype and inhibitory
 proficiency as indexed by stop-signal reaction time in
 males alone. These sexually dimorphic effects of COMT on
 inhibitory brain activation have important implications for
 our understanding of the contrasting patterns of
 prefrontally governed psychopathology observed in males and
 females.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Academy of Child and
 Adolescent Psychiatry Objective In a recent genomewide
 association study of subcortical brain volumes, a common
 genetic variation at rs945270 was identified as having the
 strongest effect on putamen volume, a brain measurement
 linked to familial risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity
 disorder (ADHD). To determine whether rs945270 might be a
 genetic determinant of ADHD, its effects on ADHD-related
 symptoms and neural mechanisms of ADHD, such as response
 inhibition and reward sensitivity, were explored. Method A
 large population sample of 1,834 14-year-old adolescents
 was used to test the effects of rs945270 on ADHD symptoms
 assessed through the Strengths and Difficulties
 Questionnaire and region-of-interest analyses of putamen
 activation by functional magnetic resonance imaging using
 the stop signal and monetary incentive delay tasks,
 assessing response inhibition and reward sensitivity,
 respectively. Results There was a significant link between
 rs945270 and ADHD symptom scores, with the C allele
 associated with lower symptom scores, most notably
 hyperactivity. In addition, there were sex-specific effects
 of this variant on the brain. In boys, the C allele was
 associated with lower putamen activity during successful
 response inhibition, a brain response that was not
 associated with ADHD symptoms. In girls, putamen activation
 during reward anticipation increased with the number of C
 alleles, most significantly in the right putamen.
 Remarkably, right putamen activation during reward
 anticipation tended to negatively correlate with ADHD
 symptoms. Conclusion These results indicate that rs945270
 might contribute to the genetic risk of ADHD partly through
 its effects on hyperactivity and reward processing in
 girls.},
